##### [THE CREAK OF FAMILIAR FARMHOUSE STAIRS. THERE IS AN INSTRUMENT BEING PLAYED SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE HOUSE, THE TINKLE OF SOMEONE LEARNING ON A SLIGHTLY OUT OF TUNE PIANO, A CONVERSATION ELSEWHERE AS WELL, LAUGHTER. AUBREY WOOD DESCENDS THE STAIRCASE. SHE GOES STRAIGHT TO THE FRONT DOOR. HESTER, HER WIFE IS IN THE KITCHEN]

#### HESTER

Morning, Aubrey, I made coffee. Well, you know. Whever the brown stuff is this month. 

#### AUBREY

Oh. Thank you. 

#### HESTER

Someone said they reckon we're getting some real beans in the next drop off. 

#### AUBREY

I'll believe it when I drink it. 

##### [AUBREY PAUSES A MOMENT TO LISTEN AS THE PIANO LEARNER CONTINUES.]

#### AUBREY

Who's learning now?

#### HESTER

One of the young ones.

#### AUBREY

We really need to move the piano. One day a storm is goin-

##### [HESTER FINISHES HER SENTENCE]

#### HESTER

A storm's going to blow this rickety old farmhouse down, yes. Why do you take your naps in here then? And why am I making you coffee in here?

#### AUBREY

Because it's the only place I can get some peace. Even with the piano. 

#### HESTER

You on your way down to see him?

#### AUBREY

No, I've got to check in on Jade first. 

#### HESTER

Jade's been up for hours. 

#### AUBREY

Well, I need to see what she's making everyone do for her then. 

#### HESTER

You're putting it off. 

#### AUBREY

I'm not putting it off. 

#### HESTER

The results were fine. He's ready. 

##### [AUBREY PULLS HER SHOES ON BY THE FRONT DOOR. HESTER'S WORDS ARE FIRM BUT SHE DELIVERS THEM GENTLY. THEY COULD BE SQUABBLING OVER THEIR TEENAGE SON.]

#### AUBREY

I... I know

#### HESTER

Then stop putting it off. 

#### AUBREY 

Hester, I'm not putting it off -

#### HESTER

You've barely spoken to him since he woke up. You send other people to sort his meds and food. He doesn't need them, he needs you. He's ready. 

#### AUBREY 

Hester. Please. I've been awake for ten minutes. 

#### HESTER 

Yes sir. Sorry sir. 

##### [AUBREY COMES BACK IN TO GET HER DRINK]

#### AUBREY

You think you're being playful but you're actually very annoying. 

#### HESTER

Take your not-coffee.

#### AUBREY

No, you take your... not-coffee... Alright then I'll be off. See you in a bit. 

##### [THEY SHARE A QUICK KISS. AUBREY LEAVES THE KITCHEN, OPENS THE DOOR AND STEPS OUT INTO THE VALLEY. A BRISK WIND IS BLOWING. THE VALLEY FLOOR IS WIDE AND OPEN WITH A DISTANCE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE BASE. THE VALLEY IS A HUB OF ACTIVITY - WORK AND PLAY, DOZENS OF PEOPLE.]   
##### [IN REAL TIME, AUBREY MAKES HER WAY ACROSS THE VALLEY FLOOR. THE SOUND OF TOOLS, SAWS AND DRILLS, ROARING FIRES, SINGING, THE ODD MUSICAL INSTRUMENT. THERE ARE MULTIPLE CALLS TO AUBREY WISHING HER A GOOD MORNING, OFFERS OF ASSISTANCE OR ATTEMPTS TO GET HERS. SHE AWKWARDLY RESPONDS AS KINDLY AS SHE CAN - SHE'S NOT COMFORTABLE IN THE CROWD.]

#### COMMUNITY 1

Morning, Aubrey!

#### AUBREY

Morning. 

#### COMMUNITY 2

#### AUBREY

Morning!

#### COMMUNITY 3

#### AUBREY

Yep. Hey.

#### COMMUNITY 4

#### AUBREY

#### COMMUNITY 5

Morning, Aubrey!

#### AUBREY

Hi, yeah!

#### COMMUNITY 6

Hey, Aubrey! You alright?

#### AUBREY

Yeah... yeah, all good. 

#### COMMUNITY 7

Morning, Aubrey!

#### AUBREY

Hiya!

#### COMMUNITY 8

Aubrey, I need that - 

#### AUBREY

Yeah, great!... I've got to hummm...

#### COMMUNITY 9

Aubrey

#### AUBREY

Yep. Hey

#### COMMUNITY 9

Aubrey, any chance I could grab you - 

#### AUBREY

Got to get to my rounds, I'll... I'll catch up with you later. 

#### COMMUNITY 9

Sure! Sure. No worries. 

#### AUBREY

Fucking h...

##### [SOON ENOUGH A BLUE SKY DRONE WHIZZES OVER TO HER. SHE SHARES A CONVERSATION WITH GORD AS SHE MAKES THE DISTANCE TO THE STATION.]

#### GORD

Good morning, Aubrey.

#### AUBREY

Morning, Gord. Could you just... Could you just hover further away?

#### GORD 

It's nearly time for Warren's alarm. 

#### AUBREY

You're as bad as Hester!

#### GORD 

I'm sorry?

#### AUBREY

I'll get there when I get there.

#### GORD 

Alright. 

#### AUBREY

You answer back more now. 

#### GORD

Analysis revealed Gordon Porlock liked to have the last word. 

#### AUBREY

Fascinating

#### GORD 

Indeed.

#### AUBREY

Alright then. 

##### [A BEAT AS SHE WALKS]

#### GORD 

Okay then. 

#### AUBREY

I can demote you in a heartbeat. You'll be running the Bluetooth connection on the white goods. 

##### [SHE REACHES THE STATION AND PULLS THE HEAVY DOOR OPEN]

#### GORD 

Fine. 

##### [AUBREY SIGHS AND ENTERS THE STATION]

-------

##### [WARREN GODBY, IN HIS QUARANTINE ROOM WITH GORD. AN ALARM CLOCK RINGS, THE SOUND OF LIGHTS FLICKERING ON]

#### GORD 

Good morning, Warren. It's 7:30 a.m. Would you like to wake up now, or have a little longer?

#### WARREN

Umm... I'll have a little longer, please. Could you put the lights back out?

#### GORD 

Sure. I'll try again in half an hour. 

#### WARREN

An hour. 

#### GORD

Sure. 

##### [WARREN LIES IN SILENCE]

#### WARREN

Gord, I know Aubrey asked you not to tell me much about the future for... reasons. Can I at least ask you a sports question?

##### [THE LIGHTS COME BACK ON]

#### GORD

Depends on the question I suppose. 

#### WARREN

How are Arsenal doing? In the Premier League?

#### GORD

Arsenal ended the last Premier League season in 16th place with a total of 52 points and a goal difference of -2. I didn't know you supported Arsenal. 

#### WARREN

I don't support anyone, they were my dad's team. 

#### GORD

I'll remember that. 

#### WARREN

There's no need. Hang on. When you said last Premier League season, did you mean the last season just gone or The Last Premier League Season?

#### GORD

You're trying to catch me out here aren't you, Warren?

#### WARREN

Gord, who is currently top of the Premier League?

#### GORD

At the end of the last Premier League season, Norwich City - 

#### WARREN

No, no, this season, right now. 

#### GORD

How do you know there's even a season in play right now?

#### WARREN

This is you trying to squabble isn't it. Distraction by squabble. 

#### GORD

This is *you* imagining its the end of the world outside and trying to trick *me* into giving you information about it. Just because there may or may not be a Premier League anymore doesn't mean a nuclear holocaust wiped out the Football Association. 

#### WARREN

You know the more I talk to you the more you remind me of actual Gordon. 

#### GORD

I'll take that as a compliment. 

#### WARREN 

You shouldn't. Now, turn the bloody lights off. 

#### GORD 

Sure. 

##### [SILENCE FOR A MOMENT]

#### WARREN 

Is Aubrey coming today?

##### [THE LIGHTS COME BACK ON.]

#### WARREN

You don't have to keep turning the lights on everytime I speak - 

##### [THE LIGHTS GO OFF]

#### GORD 

Sorry. Off they go. 

##### [WARREN REACHES FOR A GLASS OF WATER AND KNOCKS IT TO THE FLOOR.]

#### WARREN 

I didn't ask for the lights. 

#### GORD 

You spilled your water. 

#### WARREN 

I feel like I'm going to have an epileptic fit. 

#### GORD 

You don't have epilepsy. 

#### WARREN 

Can you just dim the lights and leave it at that?

##### [THE LIGHTS GO DOWN TO LOW POWER]

#### GORD 

Lights at 20%. This isn't me trying to distract you by the way. 

#### WARREN 

No, this is just *you* isn't it? Where is Aubrey?

#### GORD 

Aubrey is currently occupied with her duties in the base - 

#### WARREN 

You say that every time. It's been days since I've heard from her. When can I leave? When can I get some normal-looking food? When can I use a toilet that's not three feet from my bed? I'm not enjoying that. 

#### GORD 

Would you like it moved closer?

#### WARREN 

No!

#### GORD 

The chief concern for Aubrey is your health, both physical and mental. It's very important that we keep you calm and comfortable as you come off your mood stabilisers - 

#### WARREN 

You say that every time too. When you repeat stuff, I get nervous. When I get nervous, I start to panic. And when I start to panic I-

#### GORD 

You open your bowels. 

#### WARREN 

I - what?

#### GORD 

Each time you enter a state of anxiety, your heart rate increases to the mid 90s, your respiratory rate rises to the mid 20s, and you move to the toilet to evacuate your bowels within the subsequent 15 minutes. 

#### WARREN 

Anxiety poo is a thing that I do. It's why I don't go to music festivals. 

#### GORD 

Opening your bowels stimulates your vagus nerve which reduces your blood pressure. That might explain why you feel a little less panicked after you use the toilet. 

#### WARREN 

No one's ever told me that.

#### GORD 

The same stimulation is the cause of many deaths while on the toilet due to cardiac arrest. 

#### WARREN 

This is the worst morning so far. 

#### GORD 

Your heart rate *has* started to increase a little. 

#### WARREN 

Awesome. I hope there's enough loo roll.

#### GORD 

Would you like some Amazon rainfall sounds to relax you?

#### WARREN 

Why not. 

#### GORD 

I'll turn the lights off too. 

#### WARREN 

Great. 

##### [THE LIGHTS GO OFF. RAINFALL SOUNDS BEGIN. A MOMENT OF TRANQUILITY. SUDDENLY THE RAINFALL CUTS AND THE LIGHTS COME ON ABRUPTLY ON. THE INTERCOM SQUEALS.]

#### AUBREY

Morning! How are you, Warren?

#### WARREN

I'm... Aubrey - what answer do I have to give to get out of here?

#### AUBREY

Any answer you like, Warren. Today's the day.

##### [KEYPAD TONES. WITH A HISS, THE DOOR OPENS. AUBREY STEPS INSIDE.]

#### WARREN

Au... Aubrey...

#### AUBREY

Warren. You look like you're about to shit yourself, I know I look a bit older these days but er-

#### WARREN

No. I was... I was actually just about to er... the toilet-

#### AUBREY

Oh! I'll umm... just - I'll be outside. 

#### WARREN

Great. I'll just be err...

#### AUBREY

Take your time. 

#### WARREN

Thank you. Thank you. 

##### [AUBREY BACKS OUT OF THE DOOR AND IT CLOSES AGAIN WITH ANOTHER HISS. A PAUSE.]

#### GORD 

Shall I play the rain noise again?

#### WARREN & AUBREY (FROM BEHIND THE DOOR)

Yes!

##### [RAINFALL.]

------

##### [WARREN'S ROOM. AUBREY IS DOING A LAST CHECK ON WARREN'S READOUTS.]

#### WARREN

I'm fine, we can go. 

#### AUBREY

You've been in hypersleep decades longer than anyone has ever been before. Indulge me. Take this. 

#### WARREN

I don't want any more mood stabilisers. 

#### AUBREY

Good, we don't have many left. It's a bloody multivitamin. Go on. 

##### [WARREN TAKES THE PILL WITH A SIP OF WATER.]

#### WARREN

How long do I have to be on medication for?

#### AUBREY

Well, the drug is more than just a mood stabiliser. It keeps your mind right after the hypersleep process tries to rewire it. The longer you keep, the more you need. The trade name is Eterniteze. 

#### WARREN

Ugh. 

#### AUBREY

Overhead made it, what do you expect. Truth is, the drug is ultimately based on the brain chemistry of the first hypersleep patient. Which is you. So, I've no idea how much to give you or how long for. I guess we'll work it out. 

#### WARREN

Great. Can we go now?

#### AUBREY

The machine just takes a couple of minutes. 

#### GORD 

Just a couple of minutes. 

#### AUBREY

Yes, Gord, that's what I said. 

#### WARREN

Why did you make it sound like him?

#### AUBREY

I thought a familiar face would help you acclimatise. 

#### GORD

I don't have a face.

#### AUBREY

It's a figure of speech, Gord!

#### WARREN

Are we done after this?

#### AUBREY

No, I'm just doing a last round of obs and waiting on a blood gas before I let you run off into the future. Err... Look into this. 

#### WARREN

Ow.

#### AUBREY

Pupils are fine. You're still pretty sensitive to light. 

#### WARREN

Yeah. Because I;ve been down here for so long. 

#### AUBREY

Well, you're still in Scotland, I wouldn't worry about the sunshine. 

#### WARREN

Are you going to tell me about this future before I go running off into it?

##### [AUBREY PAUSES A MOMENT TO THINK]

#### AUBREY

I wasn't joking about the mood stabilisers. Medicines are very hard to come by and Eterniteze are rare in particular. Considering the patient load we have here and the sporadic nature of our deliveries, I can't dish them out lightly. 

#### WARREN

I never asked for them. And every time you give me another little crumb of information like that, I get more anxious. What patient load, what are you talking about?

#### AUBREY

I'm only saying... you remember how things were the last time you went into that pod. With... you. I need to be as sure as I can that you're going to be safe. I'm not going to put you back inside that thing

#### WARREN

If you really are going to let me out of this room today, then you have to let me know what I'm going into. At least a little.
