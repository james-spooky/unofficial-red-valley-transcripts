##### [THE CREAK OF FAMILIAR FARMHOUSE STAIRS. THERE IS AN INSTRUMENT BEING PLAYED SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE HOUSE, THE TINKLE OF SOMEONE LEARNING ON A SLIGHTLY OUT OF TUNE PIANO, A CONVERSATION ELSEWHERE AS WELL, LAUGHTER. AUBREY WOOD DESCENDS THE STAIRCASE. SHE GOES STRAIGHT TO THE FRONT DOOR. HESTER, HER WIFE IS IN THE KITCHEN]

#### HESTER

Morning, Aubrey, I made coffee. Well, you know. Whever the brown stuff is this month. 

#### AUBREY

Oh. Thank you. 

#### HESTER

Someone said they reckoon we're getting some real beans in the next drop off. 

#### AUBREY

I'll believe it when I drink it. 

##### [AUBREY PAUSES A MOMENT TO LISTEN AS THE PIANO LEARNER CONTINUES.]

#### AUBREY

Who's learning now?

#### HESTER

One of the young ones.

#### AUBREY

We really need to move the piano. One day a storm is goin-

##### [HESTER FINISHES HER SENTENCE]

#### HESTER

A storm's going to blow this rickety old farmhouse down, yes. Why do you take your naps in here then? And why am I making you coffee in here?

#### AUBREY

Because it's the only place I can get some peace. Even with the piano. 

#### HESTER

You on your way down to see him?

#### AUBREY

No, I've got to check in on Jade first. 

#### HESTER

Jade's been up for hours. 

#### AUBREY

Well, I need to see what she's making everyone do for her then. 

#### HESTER

You're putting it off. 

#### AUBREY

I'm not putting it off. 

#### HESTER

The results were fine. He's ready. 

##### [AUBREY PULLS HER SHOES ON BY THE FRONT DOOR. HESTER'S WORDS ARE FIRM BUT SHE DELIVERS THEM GENTLY. THEY COULD BE SQUABBLING OVER THEIR TEENAGE SON.]

#### AUBREY

I... I know

#### HESTER

Then stop putting it off. 

#### AUBREY 

Hester, I'm not putting it off-

#### HESTER

You've barely spoken to him since he woke up. You send other people to sort his meds and food. He doesn't need them, he needs you. He's ready. 

#### AUBREY 

Hester. Please. I've been awake for ten minutes. 

#### HESTER 

Yes sir. Sorry sir. 

##### [AUBREY COMES BACK IN TO GET HER DRINK]

#### AUBREY

You think you're being playful but you're actually very annoying. 

#### HESTER

Take your not-coffee.

#### AUBREY

No, you take your... not-coffee... Alright then I'll be off. See you in a bit. 

##### [THEY SHARE A QUICK KISS. AUBREY LEAVES THE KITCHEN, OPENS THE DOOR AND STEPS OUT INTO THE VALLEY. A BRISK WIND IS BLOWING. THE VALLEY FLOOR IS WIDE AND OPEN WITH A DISTANCE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE BASE. THE VALLEY IS A HUB OF ACTIVITY - WORK AND PLAY, DOZENS OF PEOPLE.]   
##### [IN REAL TIME, AUBREY MAKES HER WAY ACROSS THE VALLEY FLOOR. THE SOUND OF TOOLS, SAWS AND DRILLS, ROARING FIRES, SINGING, THE ODD MUSICAL INSTRUMENT. THERE ARE MULTIPLE CALLS TO AUBREY WISHING HER A GOOD MORNING, OFFERS OF ASSISTANCE OR ATTEMPTS TO GET HERS. SHE SWKWARDLY RESPONDS AS KINDLY AS SHE CAN - SHE'S NOT COMFORABLE IN THE CROWD.]

##### [SOON ENOUGH A BLUE SKY DRONE WHIZZES OVER TO HER. SHE SHARES A CONVERSATION WITH GORD AS SHE MAKES THE DISTANCE TO THE STATION.]

#### GORD

Good morning, Aubrey.

#### AUBREY

Morning, Gord. Could you just... Could you just hover further away?

#### GORD 

It's nearly time for Warren's alarm. 

#### AUBREY

You're as bad as Hester!

#### GORD 

I'm sorry?

#### AUBREY
