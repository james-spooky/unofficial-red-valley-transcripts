##### [PAMELA'S STOREROOM, OVERHEAD HQ. CLIVE IS ALREADY THERE, SAT IN SILENCE. PAM CAN TELL SOMETHING IS WRONG]

#### PAMELA 

You know Clive, much as I enjoy these visits, I'm not a comfortable silence kind of girl.

##### [CLIVE IS TWITCHY. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHY HE'S THERE, BUT THE REALITY IS OBVIOUS - PAM IS CLIVE'S ONLY FRIEND. HE SNIFFS, PULLING HIMSELF TOGETHER. HE PRETENDS TO LAUGH, BADLY]

#### CLIVE

Yeah, yeah. Sorry… sorry Pam.

#### PAMELA

What's up, Clive?

#### CLIVE

We didn't get Bryony Halbech.

#### PAMELA 

Okay.

#### CLIVE 

Someone else did.

#### PAMELA 

Who?

#### CLIVE 

Aubrey fucking Wood.

#### PAMELA

Aubrey Wood is alive? Jesus, how old is she?

#### CLIVE 

She did prison time in a cryopod so not as ancient as you'd think apparently. When we'd all written her off as dead, she was hypersleeping in bloody Egypt or something.

#### PAMELA

How do you know this?

#### CLIVE

Our people intercepted someone trying to get into London through an illegal channel. Do you remember Sophia Kyriacou?

#### PAMELA 

Sophia... Jesus, the bar girl? From the Aloha?

#### CLIVE

Yeah. So... weird. She was… she was so young in my memory...and now...She could've been my mother almost...

#### PAMELA

Clive, what aren't you telling me?

#### CLIVE

We caught her, brought her in. In here, to HQ, just a few floors up... Rebecca interrogated her herself.

#### PAMELA

Okay.

#### CLIVE

She didn't even tell me it was happening, I found out from the guard. When I got to the room, she was just leaving.

#### PAMELA

Rebecca was leaving? She'd finished?

#### CLIVE

She killed her, Pam.

#### PAMELA

Like, executed her?

#### CLIVE

She... she used a bone cement gun. It's like a grouting gun. She'd poured bone cement into her ears, and her nose, and her mouth. It's like paste, like... Blu Tac, and then gets hard, and it gets hot, then it gets boiling hot Pam, she... she burned her and suffocated her...

#### PAMELA

Clive...

#### CLIVE

Becky won't stop now... she… she barely listens to me... she's sending me out trying to build some kind of army for Christ's sake, I mean… what do I look like...

#### PAMELA

Clive... listen to me...

#### CLIVE

What else do I do, where else do I go, who can I... Pam... I don't know what to do...

#### PAMELA

Let's figure it out. You and me. Right here.

#### CLIVE

What?

#### PAMELA

It doesn't have to be like this.

##### [CLIVE GIVES AN INVOLUNTARY BURST OF INCREDULOUS LAUGHTER FOR A MOMENT]

#### CLIVE

I, uh. I don't know why I'm sitting her telling you all this.

##### [HE CRANES HIS HEAD AROUND, SUDDENLY NERVOUS OF HIS SURROUNDINGS]

#### CLIVE

I'm not supposed to be telling you any of this.

#### PAMELA

Hey. Hey. Look at me. We need to talk, we need to think -

#### CLIVE

No, I've got to go.

#### PAMELA

No, you don't! Wait.

#### CLIVE

No, I've got to go. Umm… I'll be back.

#### PAMELA

Clive, come back you fucking coward!

##### [HE GETS TO THE DOOR.]

#### CLIVE

Coward? Coward is right. Do you have any idea how much I wish I was you right now? Sat quietly in a storeroom? You're valuable to her. That's why you're here. That’s why you're protected. She needs you. I'm just a big mouth she can roll shit into. I thought I knew Becky Landry. I thought she had a line. And then she screwed us over so she could keep her spot in the Overhead cryonest. And then she shot Francesca Jones in the head. Then Sophia...you don't know what she did to get that information, and it was not the information she wanted to hear. Yes, I'm a coward. Enjoy your futon, Pam. Pray you stay valuable.

##### [HE MAKES TO LEAVE. PAM IS SLIGHTLY HUMBLED BUT STILL BLURTS OUT HER LAST QUESTION]

#### PAMELA

Do we at least know where they are? Bryony Halbech, Aubrey Wood?

#### CLIVE 

Oh yeah. We know where they are alright.

##### [RED VALLEY. THE INTERVIEW ROOM, THE MORNING FOLLOWING BRYONY'S ARRIVAL. AUBREY STANDS LOOKING THROUGH THE GLASS AT THE SLEEPING BRYONY HALBECH, GRACE AND HESTER SIT]

#### AUBREY

So, how did the night go?

#### HESTER

Not well.

#### AUBREY

What happened?

#### GRACE

I tried first. It went like this.

##### [GRACE HITS A BUTTON ON THE CONTROL DESK IN FRONT OF HIM. A TINNY RECORDING OF HIS ATTEMPTED INTERVIEW:]

#### GRACE (RECORDING)

Dr Halbech. Bryony. I'm aware it's been a very long
journey for y -

##### [THE SOUND OF BARE FEET ON HARD FLOOR SPRINTING ACROSS THE ROOM]

#### BRYONY (RECORDING)

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

#### GRACE (RECORDING)

Oh. Okay, we can try again later, no problem. Bye now.

##### [THE SOUND OF THE DOOR TO THE ROOM HURRIEDLY CLOSING. THE RECORDING ENDS]

#### AUBREY

Well, you have history with her just like I do, stands to reason she's going to hold a grudge. Who else has tried?

#### HESTER

I tried.

##### [GRACE HITS A BUTTON]

#### HESTER (RECORDING)

Hello Bryony. I'm here to help you -

#### BRYONY (RECORDING)

AAAAAAAAH -

#### HESTER (RECORDING)

Ooooookey dokey.

##### [GRACE CUTS THE RECORDING]

#### AUBREY

Any other takers?

#### HESTER

Stevie had a go.

#### AUBREY

Stevie?!

#### HESTER

She was being nosey. She always wants to help.

##### [CLICK]

#### STEVIE (RECORDING)

Hullo! I just wanted to pop in and - fuckin' hell she's throwing a shoe!

##### [BRYONY'S NEXT SCREAM IS CUT VERY SHORT BY GRACE]

#### AUBREY

What's her situation now?

#### GRACE

She's still in there.

#### AUBREY

In the dark?

#### GRACE

You can see her if you get right up to the glass and
squint.

##### [PAUSE]

#### AUBREY

She's... she's just lying on the floor.

#### HESTER

She screamed herself to sleep.

#### AUBREY

Alright. Any other ideas?

#### GRACE

Give her the Eterniteze.

#### AUBREY

Not until we've exhausted every other option.
 
#### HESTER

You know what you need her to do. You know what she needs to be able to do it. Just give her the drugs.

#### AUBREY

We are running very low. And we have people who need
those drugs. More than she does.

#### HESTER

They deserve them more than she does. That's not the
same thing.

#### AUBREY

Let's just… let's just make sure we've gone through every reasonable option first.

##### [AUBREY PUTS DOWN A BAG SHE WAS HOLDING]

#### GRACE

What's in the bag, Aubrey?

##### [SHE UNZIPS IT AND THE COLD METALLIC SOUND OF A WEAPON BEING CHECKED OVER]

#### HESTER

Are you serious?

#### AUBREY

I won't have to use it.

#### GRACE

You're going in there?

#### AUBREY

Would you rather send every other person in the station in first? Jesus, you sent Stevie in, she's the nicest person here. She could talk lemmings back from cliffs with that accent.

#### GRACE

I would rather we just accept we need to use the mood
stabilisers -

##### [AUBREY BANGS ON THE WINDOW WITH HER WEAPON. SHE HITS THE BUTTON TO SPEAK]

#### AUBREY

Wakey wakey. Dr Halbech.

------

##### [CUT TO THE AUDIO INSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM. THE STIRRING AND COUGHING OF BRYONY HALBECH AS SHE WAKES UP ON THE FLOOR. THE LOUD BUZZ OF STRIP LIGHTS BEING TURNED ON. AUBREY'S VOICE ECHOES A LITTLE FROM THE TANNOY - THIS IS A BIGGER SPACE THAN THE OLD INTERVIEW ROOM]

#### AUBREY

Good morning, Bryony. I'm going to come in and speak to you now. But I want you to know - I won't have any of this funny business. In my hand I have a dart gun. Now we got a few of these literally off the back of a lorry a while ago so it is not a top quality piece of kit. The darts are very sophisticated, they're meant to cause localised paralysis. Very good at de-escalating a situation. However - the only darts we managed to get are a bit dodgy. Some of them work just fine and will knock out an arm or a leg for a good couple of hours. Some of them, however, don't do that at all, and simply cause your anal sphincter to relax. As in, they make you shit yourself. And we have no way of knowing which ones are which. Now, I don't want to use this, and you definitely don't want me to use this. So, let's be nice.

##### [THE TANNOY SQUEALS TO SILENCE. WITH SOME EFFORT A GROGGY BRYONY PULLS HERSELF UP TO STANDING. AFTER A MOMENT AUBREY ENTERS THE ROOM. THEY ARE SOME DISTANCE APART]

#### AUBREY

See, I'm putting the dart gun down. Over here.

##### [SHE PLACES THE GUN ON THE FLOOR. A MOMENT PASSES AS AUBREY COMPOSES HERSELF, FACED WITH BRYONY HALBECH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER 40 YEARS]

#### AUBREY

I know what it feels like to be angry. I know how it feels to hate. And the realisation that you also know just what to do with that anger and hate, how you can utilise it, how you can weaponise it...That's a scary moment. Well, it was for me. Maybe that's the difference between us. Anyway Bryony, what I'm getting at is... I hate you. You know when -
##### [WITH A SCREAM BRYONY CHARGES AT AUBREY FROM ACROSS THE ROOM. AUBREY IS UNFAZED]

#### AUBREY

- oh right, here she comes. I see what you mean.
  
#### BRYONY REACHES HER TARGET. AUBREY EFFORTLESSLY LIFTS BRYONY OVER, LANDING HER ON HER BACK WITH A THUD. BRYONY GASPS AS THE AIR IS KNOCKED OUT OF HER. AUBREY WALKS AWAY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM. HESTER COMES ON OVER THE TANNOY]

#### HESTER

Uh… Aubrey, I don't think -

#### AUBREY

It's fine. I was saying, you know when you fall in love, like *really* fall in love, the love that makes you realise all the other times you were in love weren't even love at all because this, *this* is love. I'd never truly hated someone until I was alone in that cryo suite with the dead eyes of Winnie the fucking Pooh staring back at me and I knew, by God, I hated Bryony Halbech.

##### [BRYONY HAS PULLED HERSELF TOGETHER AGAIN. HER BONES CLICK AS SHE STRETCHES HERSELF OUT. AUBREY DOES NOT REACT AT ALL]

#### AUBREY

For a while I told myself it was more complicated than that. I told myself it was Overhead, I told myself it was hypersleep, I told myself that it was myself that I hated. But it wasn't. It was just you.

##### [BRYONY CHARGES AGAIN]

#### AUBREY

Hmm. Here we go again.

#### BRYONY

SHUTTTTTTT UPPPPPP!

##### [THEY COLLIDE AGAIN, AND JUST AS BEFORE, BRYONY ENDS UP ON THE FLOOR WITH A CRACK AND A GASP, NOTHING MORE THAN A MILD GRUNT OF EXERTION FROM AUBREY. THE TANNOY SQUEALS]

#### GRACE

Uh... Maybe we should stay away from the 'I hate you' stuff.

#### AUBREY

Maybe we should get some crash mats in here.

##### [SHE WALKS AWAY FROM BRYONY AGAIN WHO IS GROANING, ROLLING OVER]

#### AUBREY

If you're interested, what's happening here is called aikido. It's known as 'the gentle art'. It's basically using someone's momentum against them. A lot of flipping people over, it's great fun. Grace has been teaching me over the years. He uses it as a channel for feelings of anger or frustration and I've been trying to do the same. If you like I'm sure he could show – uh… one more time then.

#### [WITHOUT REALLY PREPARING HERSELF THIS TIME BRYONY LUNGES CLUMSILY AT AUBREY WHO HALF HEARTEDLY LANDS HER ON HER BACK ONCE AGAIN. THIS TIME SHE LEANS IN CLOSER]

#### AUBREY

I haven't brought you all the way here to punish you, Bryony. It doesn't help me, it doesn't help you. The truth is, and it brings me no pleasure whatsoever to say this... in all seriousness... I need you. I need your mind. We can all agree that you have a brilliant mind. Or at least had. I hope you're still in there, Bryony. Because if this is all you've got to give, then all I've got in return is my anger, and my hate. And I don't want to live like that. So, let's stop all this messing around, and get to work putting something right. Take my hand.

##### [A PAUSE. EVENTUALLY, BRYONY TAKES AUBREY'S HAND. AUBREY PULLS HER UP, AND IN THAT MOMENT BRYONY PULLS FREE. AUBREY FOR THE FIRST TIME IS FLUSTERED]

#### AUBREY

Bryony -

##### [WITH ALL HER REMAINING STRENGTH, BRYONY CRACKS AUBREY ACROSS THE FACE. THE TANNOY SQUEALS, BRYONY IS DELIGHTED WITH HER EFFORT. HER VOICE IS THIN, RASPING, BUT FILLED WITH PURPOSE]

#### BRYONY

Put that right, you charity shop Sarah Connor ska -

##### [BRYONY'S WORDS ARE CUT OFF AS SHE RECEIVES A CHOP TO THE THROAT THAT MAKES HER GASP AND CHOKE. AUBREY EXPRESSES NO EMOTION AT ALL OTHER THAN A SIGH]

#### AUBREY

Hot dog.

AS BRYONY TRIES TO BREATHE, AUBREY LAMPS HER ACROSS THE JAW AND SHE DROPS LIKE A SACK OF SPUDS. AUBREY WALKS CALMLY TO THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.

#### AUBREY

Jumping frog.

##### [BRYONY GETS TO HER KNEES AND STRUGGLES TO HER FEET AS AUBREY PICKS UP THE DART GUN, COCKING IT. WITH A GUTTURAL SCREAM BRYONY RUNS ONE LAST TIME, AND AUBREY SHOOTS HER IN THE LEG. BRYONY YELLS AND SKIDS TO THE FLOOR, WHIMPERING IN PAIN]

AUBREY

Albuquerque.

##### [A MOMENT OF RELATIVE QUIET. EVENTUALLY GRACE COMES OVER THE TANNOY, CALM AS YOU LIKE]

#### GRACE

Aubrey, do you think we could have a quick word?

------

##### [AUBREY ENTERS THE CONTROL ROOM TO A STONY SILENCE]

#### GRACE

We may need to discuss our definitions of reasonable
options.

#### AUBREY

It could've gone a lot worse.

#### HESTER

How?

#### AUBREY

She didn't shit herself.

#### GRACE

We may need a higher bar for success if we are to
progress.

#### AUBREY

We're trying everything. Now we know she doesn't respond well to...roughhousing.

#### HESTER

How about monologuing? Or being shot?

##### AUBREY

Both areas she used to excel in, it must be hard being on
the other end.

HESTER

Now you've got that out of your system, do you have any constructive ideas on how we move forward, or should we have kept a receipt?

#### AUBREY: Yeah, I've got a great idea actually.

------

##### [THE OFFICE ON THE GROUND FLOOR. WARREN IS NOW PART OF THE
GROUP]

#### WARREN

This is a terrible idea.

##### [HESTER AND GRACE SPEAK AT THE SAME TIME]

GRACE: Yep.
HESTER: Uhm… I agree.

#### AUBREY

We could at least experiment with positivity, everyone.

#### WARREN

This can't have been the plan all along. You wanted us kept apart.

#### AUBREY

Yeah, that's true.

#### WARREN

Which actually was a great idea.
