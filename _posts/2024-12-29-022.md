##### [CLIVE SCHILL KNOCKS ON THE OPEN DOOR OF REBECCA LANDRY'S OFFICE.]

#### CLIVE

Becky?

##### [REBECCA IS BUSY BUT WAVES HIM IN.]

#### REBECCA

Hey, hey, come in. 

#### CLIVE

How's it going?

##### [BECKY LOOKS AT HER PAPERWORK AND WITH A WITH A SIGH, THROWS HER PEN ON TO THE DESK IN DEFEAT.]

#### REBECCA

You know before I started helping my dad in R&D I was a
sales rep.

#### CLVIE

Yeah, I… I think he mentioned that to me once.
Biomedical stuff, wasn't it?

#### REBECCA

I used to travel the world trying to sell bone cement. You know when old people break their hips and knees and whatever and they need replacing, you use a special kind of cement to hold it all in place. I would sell that to hospitals and surgeons.

#### CLIVE

Sounds Interesting. 

#### REBECCA

It was not. But I was very good at making people think it was. Plus I would always stop by a shop on the way to a hospital and buy doughnuts or something. It was easier to sell people something if you were holding out a doughnut at the same time. 

#### CLIVE

Sure. 

##### [REEBCCA RUBS HER TEMPLES, EXHAUSTED ALREADY.]

#### REBECCA

This morning I've already spoken to three different divisions of the Bastion or whoever these bloody people are who run everything these days. I've used every trick I've got to charm and bullshit them. And I'm realising that maybe I depended more on those doughnuts than I thought. 

#### CLIVE

How many of these Bastion gits are there?

##### [REBECCA LOOKS AT A CHAOTIC PILE OF PAPERS IN FRONT OF HER.]

#### REBECCA

Who knows? There's no discernible central leadership, everyone seems to think they're in charge, and I swear to God I haven't met a single one who's over 25. They've all got the most absurd names. I just got off a call with a guy called Total Bishop Kingsley Lordbox.

#### CLIVE

What?

#### REBECCA

He looks like he should be waiting tables at a Harvester. Instead, he commands a militia of 500 men all dedicated to hunting down anyone associated with cryotech. They're called the Assembly of Absolute Ascent. They're based in Brentford and they have a tank.

#### CLIVE

Fucking hell!

#### REBECCA

And just like the others, they want to know what the hell the ex-CEOs of the company that invented Kontinue are suddenly doing back in town, and whether or not they should pop over with that tank and pay us a visit.

#### CLIVE

This sounds like a stressful morning. I mean... I could try and find doughnuts. Did you know that Greggs doesn't exist anymore?

#### REBECCA

You know it would be nice if we could share the load actually when it comes to dealing with these tools, but they literally won't talk to you because of your swearing.

#### CLIVE

Sanctimonious little shits.

#### REBECCA

Clive. 

#### CLIVE

Dickless little pricks. I'm sorry.

#### REBECCA

You do swear too much, Clive.

#### CLIVE

I'm trying. I'm fucking trying

##### [REBECCA RUBS HER TEMPLES, AGAIN.]

#### REBECCA

I... I just...I don't know how to navigate this world. It doesn't matter how much research I'm brought, how many lessons in geo-politics 2040 to 2060 I'm made to sit through. There's no logic to any of it. Everyone's just a bullfrog ribbiting over the last of the standing water. It's deafening. 

#### CLIVE

You said there was new intel. 

#### REBECCA

Yeah. There is. 

#### CLIVE

Okay. Is it... legit?

##### REBECCA

I don't know. I've already put some more people in the field to follow it up but seriously, Clive, the Bastion might look like packs of insane little children running around with scissors but they're not messing about. Aubrey Wood ran a terrorist group. Yes, they were very bloody good at what they did, and don't we know it, but they were underground, extremists. The Bastion are the police, the church, the government. Any sniff that we're looking for cryo tech or... or cryo people...

#### CLIVE

Right... We just... we just keep to the same line, alright? That we're trying to help them apprehend cryo scientists, not take them for ourselves.

#### REBECCA

If the intel is right then it doesn't get much bigger than this. We have to be careful. 

#### CLIVE

And I'm just saying, some things are worth the risk. And you know if this is what we think it is, then maybe... maybe we could go easier on...

#### REBECCA

Clive. I don't want to talk about Pamela.

##### [CLIVE IS NOT CONFIDENT IN HIS APPROACH BUT HE TRIES ANYWAY.]

#### CLIVE

Becky, it's not right, keeping her locked up like that...

#### REBECCA

I'm not going through this again. As you can see I've got a lot on-

#### CLIVE

Pam is one of us. We owe her more than locking her uplike a dog. She could at least have the run of the building,she doesn't even have a bed -

##### [BECKY GOES STRAIGHT TO A TEN. HER HAND SMACKS THE TABLE HARD AND LOUD.]

#### REBECCA

Clive! I am spending all day every day trying to run what is left of this company. I am trying to find a way out of this horrible place. I am trying to get us back into hypersleep with no cryonests, no cryopods and no Red Valley. And I am doing it under the intense glare of an apparently never-ending line of fascist fun police who literally hang, draw and quarter anyone involved in cryo tech. I am saving Pamela's life.

#### CLIVE

You're punishing her. We only got as far as 2064 because of Pam.

#### REBECCA

Losing 20 years in the process where we might've found a cryonest that wasn't built by an alcoholic with some toilet roll holders and a Pritt Stick!

#### CLIVE

You remember you weren't actually invited to that house party, right? And it only existed because you wouldn't spare a couple of pods for us in the first place?

#### REBECCA

Clive, what the hell is happening to you? I thought you wanted to get out of here. To get to the future, to see your daughter again -

#### CLIVE

Yes… yes, of course I want to get out of here -

#### REBECCA

Then get your mind right. Stop complaining that Pam Jennings doesn't have an ensuite and find us a way out of this. I don't need Ghandi as my right-hand man. I need the fucking T1000.

#### CLIVE

Yes ma'am.

#### REBECCA

Have you found any more recruits?

#### CLIVE

Plenty. There's a biker gang based in Woolwich that was easy to win over, got no love for the Bastion, always up for a ruckus by the sounds of it.

#### REBECCA 

Another biker gang. 

#### CLIVE

Well, I'm trying to find some fighting Uruk-hai, but they don't use social media. What are you expecting?

#### REBECCA

Clive, we need a better class of goon. How about tech?

#### CLIVE

We've got 40 reconnaissance drones but they're old, a few of them have got tasers at least. Oh, and someone managed to find a lock up in the basement level that had 5 of those robotic dog things with machine guns on their heads.

#### REBECCA 

For God's sake, robotic dog things -

#### CLIVE

I know, I know -

##### [REBECCA'S PHONE BLEEPS. SHE TAKES A BREATH AND ANSWERS IT CALMLY.]
