#### WARREN

Well, you seem very trusting, whoever you are.

#### AUBREY

I'm pointing pepper spray at your face.

#### WARREN

Oh excellent.

##### [THE SOUND OF ZIPS AND RUSTLING AS WARREN REMOVES HIS HAT AND SCARF, UNZIPS HIS JACKET.]

#### AUBREY

Good lord.

#### WARREN

Yes.

#### AUBREY

Warren Godby!

#### WARREN

Yes! Yes, it's me. Everyone says my name like that now. Makes me feel like Harry Potter.

#### AUBREY

I’m sorry, I didn’t recognise you with the hat and the scarf...Do you...do you remember me?

#### WARREN

I don't but don't be offended. It doesn't reflect on the quality of impression you may have made on me, more my own mental hygiene which is questionable at best.

#### AUBREY

It's Dr Aubrey. Dr Wood. Aubrey. Wood. Let me boil the kettle.

##### [SHE FUSSES FOR A MOMENT WITH A SMALL CAMPING KETTLE AND A PAIR OF TIN MUGS.]

#### WARREN

Ah well, that makes sense.

#### AUBREY

Why does that make sense?

#### WARREN

Well Dr Aubrey Dr Wood Aubrey Wood. It seems a lot of the real things that have happened to me I don't remember, and a lot of the things I remember have turned out to not actually be real. So here I am taking a walk in a snowstorm, and out of nowhere is a Mazda Bongo Friendee, and inside that Mazda Bongo Friendee is Aubrey Wood. I think there's at least a passing chance that none of this is real and I'm out here to have, I don’t know an epiphany of some kind, and you're like my...Obi Wan Kenobi.

##### [THE KETTLE IS BOILING, THEIR VOICES RAISE.]

#### AUBREY

Obi Wan Kenobi?

#### WARREN

Yeah. Maybe I've passed out in the snow like Luke Skywalker, maybe I'm just screaming into the wind who knows. And here you are to tell me to go to the Dagobah system /, learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who- / yes, yes, you know it, of course.

#### AUBREY

/ Oh, the Empire Strikes Back? Shall we wait on the kettle for a moment?

#### WARREN

Yeah sure, why not?

##### [THE KETTLE IS BUBBLING. IT CLICKS OFF.]

#### AUBREY

Sorry...Warren. Can we start again?

#### WARREN

Yeah, of course.

#### AUBREY

I'm not your Jedi spirit guide / but if I was, why would it be me, Aubrey, if you don't remember meeting me? /

#### WARREN

/Spirit guide. I like that./ Well I know you from all your tapes.

#### AUBREY

My *tapes*?

#### WARREN

The ones you gave Gordon Porlock. Well I assume you gave them to him. /

#### AUBREY

/You know Gordon Porlock?

#### WARREN

I never asked how he got them actually. Yes yes, of course. Gordon’s back at the station. He's the caretaker.

#### AUBREY

Gordon Porlock is at Red Valley, with you, right now?

#### WARREN

Well, right now I'm with my Jedi spirit guide.

#### AUBREY

Okay. I need to go back to the start, please.

#### WARREN

Absolutely, So, Luke is lost on the ice planet Hoth -

#### AUBREY

No, no, no, the start. Of this.

#### WARREN

Oh right. Well, that all started when Doug Holder, my manager, sent me to chase a budget review case for Accounts, which I now think was a deliberate breadcrumb trail for me to find my way back to Red Valley, and on the way I met Gordon, who I thought for a while might be in on the whole conspiracy but it seems to have just been a fortuitous coincidence -

#### AUBREY

Stop, stop stop stop. What is this the start of?

#### WARREN

Well… My adventures in hypersleep. Oh. Oh I see, you want to go back to the start start. I understand, I've had counselling before, this is good, get me to open up. Facilitate the epiphany. I was born in Gravesend, in Kent, in 1982. I have a sister called Emily and I'm here because...well, poor decision mak-

#### AUBREY

No no no no.  Stop.

#### WARREN

I don't have any more starts.

#### AUBREY

Let me think for a minute. I'll pour the tea.

#### WARREN

Sure.

#### AUBREY

Actually, there's a Bakewell tart behind you. By the, on the shelf there. In the carrier bag.

#### WARREN

Ooh! I bloody love Bakewell tart.

##### [THE RUSTLE OF A PLASTIC BAG, THE CRINKLE OF CELLOPHANE BEING REMOVED, THE TART BEING TAKEN FROM THE BOX, THE POURING OF TEA.]

##### [AUBREY PASSES THE TEA.]

#### AUBREY

Okay. Warren. You and I met in a penal facility in Norfolk a few years ago.

#### WARREN

Yes, yes! I think I know that. You were screening for candidates for the Teddy Bear's Picnic.

#### AUBREY

How do you know tha-

#### WARREN

I didn't make it on to the programme for whatever reason, then once that was over apparently they came back for me, and some of the others, and we were in the next programme. I don't know if that had a silly name too.

#### AUBREY

Yes. And I have been trying to work out exactly what they've been doing since...since I left the company.

##### [AUBREY GOES TO A BAG AND PULLS OUT A STACK OF FILES.]

#### WARREN

Since all those people died and Bryony Halbech abandoned you.

#### AUBREY

Yes. After Teddy Bear's Picnic I didn't know where they would go next but I still knew all the rejected candidates we had interviewed, so I checked on them occasionally and sure enough, they just went back and hoovered up all the people who didn't make it first time around. They must've been desperate. No offence.

#### WARREN

None taken, spirit guide.

#### AUBREY

I'm not your spirit guide, Warren. I mean, the reason we chose who we chose for the Teddy Bear's Picnic was because of their physical condition, not just their health but their family's...no history of Alzheimer's or any form of dementia or brain cancers or neurological disease of any kind, a completely clean bill of physical and mental health. You...everyone else had red flags...

##### [SHE RIFLES THROUGH FILES. SHE FINDS HIS.]

#### AUBREY

Your, uh, your mother, she had...

#### WARREN

A… An aneurysm. You have a file?

#### AUBREY

Yes, that was it, an aneurysm. And there were multiple cancers and so on in your family weren’t there...

#### WARREN

You probably know more about that than I do.

##### [SUDDENLY SHE SHUTS THE FILE.]

#### AUBREY

Wait, wait.

#### WARREN

What now? We were just getting into it.

#### AUBREY

I'm doing this all backwards. I...I wasn't expecting this at all. Warren Godby to appear out of a blizzard.

#### WARREN

Sorry.

#### AUBREY

Are you on your own? Why were you out there?

#### WARREN

I just needed some air. Felt like I hadn't had fresh air for months. Which is true of course, I guess I haven't had any air for months, fresh or otherwise.

#### AUBREY

What does that mean?

#### WARREN

Since I Kontinued.

#### AUBREY

Since you *what?*

#### WARREN

Since they woke me up. Are we going to cut this tart, or just stare at it?

#### AUBREY

Fuck the tart. What did you just say?

#### WARREN

Well, I was in hypersleep. For 3 months.

#### AUBREY

You...you've already done it. You've been in hypersleep? For 3 months?

#### WARREN

Three months this time. One month the first time. And that first time that’s the one that really fucked with me. That's why I don't remember meeting you. I certainly don't remember being in prison. Or how I got there. So that must be like 2 years I lost.

#### AUBREY

Jesus Christ.

#### WARREN

Could you pass the knife?

##### [SHE PASSES THE KNIFE.]

#### WARREN

Thank you.

##### [WARREN CUTS TWO SLICES AND IMMEDIATELY DIGS INTO HIS.]

#### WARREN

This is very good technique. You're freaking out, which is making me calm down. There's tea, there's tart, this van is adorable, whether it's real or not.

#### AUBREY

Who's there? At the station right now, I've been watching people come and go for weeks but too far away to identify anyone.

#### WARREN

Well, there’s me, Gordon...

#### AUBREY

Why is Gordon there?

#### WARREN

We came together and they kind of strong-armed him into taking a Jack Torrance in The Shining type caretaker job. Unless...

#### AUBREY

Unless what?

#### WARREN

Well, maybe this is another part of Grace's stupid memory test. Maybe Gordon's a fucking set up as well, who knows. I mean I thought Bryony Halbech was my wife for like a year, so -

#### AUBREY

Bryony Halbech? Bryony's there now?

#### WARREN

I mean, yes? I guess? She could've turned into smoke or beamed back to her home planet by now.

#### AUBREY

We definitely know the same Bryony Halbech.

#### WARREN

That was good cheap cake. Thank you. Spirit guide or not. I should probably be getting back though, are you going to impart some wisdom or something?

#### AUBREY

I don't know what to say.

#### WARREN

Then why are you here?

#### AUBREY

Look, I'm not your bloody spirit guide. I'm Aubrey Wood. I live in this van, I haven't spoken to anyone apart from please and thank yous in weeks, I live on supernoodles and cakes, I haven't had a proper bath in 18 months. I'm at least partially responsible for everything that's happened to you. And I'm directly responsible for the deaths of every subject in that stupid terrible picnic, and now I'm sat here night after night freezing to death, poetically enough, and it's all happening down the damn road right now, everything I wanted and now everything I want to stop, it's happening right now -

#### WARREN

Hey, hey, hey. Aubrey. Come on, it's okay.

##### [SHE GATHERS HERSELF.]

#### AUBREY

I'm only saying. If you're looking for wisdom, you've come to the wrong minivan. I'm just another idiot in the snow.

#### WARREN

I told you I listened to your tapes. I don't think you're a bad person.

#### AUBREY

You don't think I'm a real person.

#### WARREN

Well, on the off chance that you are. We're more than just a list of all the bad things we've done.

#### AUBREY

That almost sounded wise. Maybe you got your epiphany after all.

#### WARREN

My mum would say it. When she would defend my dad. But everything's context I suppose.

##### [THEY SIT IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT. SIPPING TEA. EATING TART.]

#### AUBREY

Well. Stealing this file was one of my first acts of espionage. I don't know if anything in it is useful, but it belongs to you.

#### WARREN

Oh.

#### AUBREY

If you want it, of course.

#### WARREN

No… yeah...the tea and cake was a lovely surprise, let's not spoil it. And hey, I've listened to your tapes, you've read my file, we know all this stuff about each other, it's a bit like...

#### AUBREY

Like we're friends.

#### WARREN

I was going to say massively invading each other's privacy.

#### AUBREY

Right. Well, that's a bit like friends.

#### WARREN

I mean. I really wouldn't know.

#### AUBREY

Me either.

##### [AN AWKWARD SILENCE.]

#### AUBREY

I'm sorry. I'm just… I’m wondering what to do next. I wanted to stop anyone else getting hurt at Red Valley, and here you are...We should drive away, shouldn't we? Or I should come back with you and I don't know...do a Rambo?

#### WARREN

No, no, look, I'm just sat on the train. There's leaves on the line, hopefully I've got a book, I'm just gonna lean back and go with it.

#### AUBREY

I don't know what any of that means.

#### WARREN

And Clive Schill would probably brain you with a fire extinguisher by the sound of it.

#### AUBREY

Clive Schill is there! Oh, that man is such a bell end!

#### WARREN

He called me a bell end today! He's so mean. Speaking of which he is probably out here looking for me.

##### [HE REACHES INTO HIS COAT AND PULLS OUT HIS COMM.]

#### AUBREY

You have a comm with you.

#### WARREN

Yeah, Gordon gave me his. We talk on sneaky channel 6 but everyone else...

#### AUBREY

Is on channel 2!

#### WARREN

Bingo.

##### [HE SWITCHES IT ON AND TURNS TO CHANNEL 2.]

#### CLIVE SCHILL

Grace! Have you got eyes on this prick yet? If your answer is no I've got a fire extinguisher I want you to meet. Gonna bash your fucking hea-

##### [WARREN CLICKS IT OFF.]

#### WARREN

I mean really you could set your watch by him, couldn't you. If you want to stay a secret squirrel, I'd better be off.

#### AUBREY

Warren...could I - could I have that?

#### WARREN

The comm? Yeah sure, there's loads.

##### [WARREN PASSES IT OVER. AUBREY IS AWARE WHAT AN IMPORTANT GIFT THIS IS.]

#### AUBREY

Thank you.

#### WARREN

Thank you. This has been really nice. And if I am just talking to myself in the snow, it's been a really pleasant way of losing my mind.

#### AUBREY

Oh, wait, wait!

#### WARREN

What?

#### AUBREY

I can prove I'm real. I record everything.

##### [SHE GRABS A LAPTOP AND STARTS TAPPING.]

#### WARREN

You... record everything?

#### AUBREY

Yes, all of this, I can put it on a stick and you can listen again later when you're...when you're in the mood. And you'll know it's all real. Here you go.

#### WARREN

You people and your recording. You can take the girl out of Overhead...

#### AUBREY

Truer than you know.

#### WARREN

Right. Well, see you later then.

##### [HE OPENS THE DOOR TO LEAVE. THE WIND HOWLS IN.]

#### AUBREY

Oh, oh. Was Gordon here over Christmas?

#### WARREN

Er… yeah, I think they left him in charge.

#### AUBREY

Ah. Could you apologise to him for me? I think I drove the van a little too close on Christmas Eve. Scared the shit out of some guy with eyes like a mole and a screechy voice.

#### WARREN

That sounds like Gordon. Will do. Toodle pip.

#### AUBREY

And Warren. I want you to remember. If you've really been through hypersleep twice and survived, you might be the most valuable commodity Overhead have ever had. Don't let them forget it.

#### [2020. THE TEAM, IN THE STATION OFFICE, GROUND LEVEL, GRACE TAPS THE WINDOW.]

#### GRACE
That's him. That's him, that's him.

#### CLIVE 
Fucking let me see. That plate of shit, I'm going to fucking kill that guy.

#### GRACE

He looks fine.

#### GORDON

Let me go out and speak to him.

#### CLIVE

You want to go and speak to him?

#### GRACE

He looks totally fine.

#### GORDON

I can make sure he's okay.

#### BRYONY

Maybe let him go.

#### CLIVE

Maybe let him go? Let him go? Who's in charge here? This guy? This piss-drinking motherfucker?

#### GORDON

I've never done that.

#### CLIVE

Oh you floridly drink piss.

#### PAMELA

He's nearly at the door.

#### GRACE

I'll go.

#### PAMELA

You're going to go?

#### BRYONY

Grace. Just, back off. Go and make things ready downstairs.

#### GRACE

We made a connection. He trusts me.

#### PAMELA

Oh my God. You are ridiculous.

#### CLIVE

Fucking amateur hour here.

#### BRYONY

You picked these guys, not me.

#### CLIVE

I didn't pick Uncle Fucknut the piss fiend.

#### GORDON

Bryony. This is why I'm here isn't it? To help him.

#### CLIVE

You were the prick who let him go in the first place!

#### BRYONY

That is true.

#### GORDON

I'm sorry about that. He's clearly having trouble, I think that's to be expected -

#### PAMELA

Grace, where are you going?

#### GRACE

I'm going to see him.

#### PAMELA

Why -

#### BRYONY

What did I just tell you to do?

#### CLIVE

Degracious Melé, don't you go anywhere near that door -

##### [THE DOOR OPENS LOUDLY IN THE CORRIDOR. WARREN STEPS IN AND STARTS TO TAKE OFF HIS HEAVY COAT, HAT AND GLOVES.]

#### WARREN

Hello everyone!

#### GORDON

Hi Warren!

#### CLIVE

You stupid arsehole.

#### WARREN

Clive, it’s fine, I just went for a walk.

#### GRACE

Warren, it's me, Doctor Melé.

#### PAMELA

*Doctor Melé?!*

#### CLIVE

You could’ve slipped over on the ice and broke your fucking head, you could’ve got hypothermia and fucking died -

#### PAMELA

That’s literally not possible

#### BRYONY

He has cryoprotectant for blood, Clive.

#### WARREN

That's sweet of you, Clive.

#### CLIVE

I don’t give a shit about you, you dozy prick, I’ll eat your fucking teeth -

#### WARREN

That’s more like it.

#### BRYONY

Downstairs. Everyone. Walk.

##### [EVERYONE STARTS HERDING TOWARDS THE STAIRCASE.]

#### GRACE

Warren, I understand this must be a trying time, now tell me, how do you feel at this mome-

#### WARREN

Could you take my coat? Gordon -

#### GORDON

I’m here, do you need to take my arm?

#### WARREN

I'm good, can you just hold on to my gloves -

#### GORDON

Yeah, where's your comm -

#### WARREN

Oh, I lost that somewhere.

#### CLIVE

He lost it.

#### WARREN

Could you make sure they go on a radiator? I don’t want them getting damp.

#### GORDON

Uh, yeah...

#### WARREN

Seriously, they'll smell otherwise.

#### GORDON

Okay.

#### CLIVE

Bryony, you really think you’ve got this shit under control?

#### BRYONY

Oddly enough, it only got like this after you arrived.

#### CLIVE

Oh this is me, is it?

#### BRYONY

He’s here, he’s fine.

#### CLIVE

You need more people here.

#### BRYONY

I need the right people here!

#### GRACE

I’m doing my best.

#### PAMELA

You’re doing too much.

#### GRACE

You can never do too much. You see this is why you’ll never be on top.

#### PAMELA

Oh shut up. You’re not the Wolf of Wall Street.

#### GORDON

Warren, where did you go?

#### WARREN

Nowhere, nowhere. Just... just look after those gloves, they look expensive.

#### GORDON

Okay, okay.

##### [THEY EMERGE IN THE LOWER LEVEL.]

#### GORDON

What are we even doing back down here? He 
needs to rest. 
Grace, I told you to get things set up. Do I have to 
ask you again? 
Set up set up? 
Wait what are we -  
I’m fine with it, I’d just like to talk to you all - 
Dr Halbech are we - do you want him back in 
hypersleep? 
I thought that was obvious. 
Wh… What? 
Is it not obvious? 
Look, I want to punish the little piss drinker as 
much as you  -
