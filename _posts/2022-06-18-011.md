##### [GORDON AND WARREN ARE IN THE DISUSED MEDICAL BAY ON THE GROUND FLOOR, PLAYING REBOUNDS WITH A TENNIS BALL]
##### [WARREN IS OCCASIONALLY SHORT OF BREATH AND HAS A PERSISTENT COUGH]

#### WARREN

So, the Pus Crank Christmas medley was called Beth-mayhem?

#### GORDON

O Little Town of Bethmayhem. We did several actually.

#### WARREN

Oh yeah, what were they called?

#### GORDON

God Rest Ye Metal Gentlemen.

#### WARREN

Good.

#### GORDON

The First No-Hell.

#### WARREN

That’s very good!

#### GORDON

Good King Wencesthrash.

#### WARREN

Wencesthrash?

#### GORDON

Yeah, I mean… It's harder than you think.

##### [WARREN TAKES A MOMENT TO THINK]

#### WARREN

We Wish You A Metal Christmas.

#### GORDON

Um, no… Too easy.

##### [WARREN MISHITS THE BALL]

#### GORDON

Oh, are you alright?

#### WARREN

Yeah, Yeah, I’m fine.

#### GORDON

Two shoots to me for that!

#### WARREN

I know.

##### [GORDON HITS THE BALL, WARREN TAKES HIS TURN ENTHUSIASTICALLY]

#### WARREN (con't)

While Shepherds Rocked Their Socks By Night!

#### GORDON

Um, yeah that one’s better!

#### WARREN

The 12 Days of Crustmas.

#### GORDON:

Yes!

##### [CUT. WARREN AND GORDON PLAYING GOLDENEYE]

#### WARREN

Would you rather...do a tiny shit every hour on the hour, or spend one week a year doing all your shits in one go?

#### GORDON

Is this during sleeping hours as well?

#### WARREN

For which? The every hour one?

#### GORDON

Yeah, yeah. No. Wait. No, both of them. I mean… you couldn't shit for a full week 24/7 without sleep.

#### WARREN

You get to sleep as normal.

#### GORDON

Okay umm… Would the week be exempt from annual leave or sick pay entitlements? Does this impact the whole human race or just me personally? I'd hate to lose a week of holiday just because I - Oh! Ha ha ha ha!

#### WARREN

Oh my God! Fuck sake.

#### GORDON

That is why you don't play as Baron Samedi on Goldeneye.

#### WARREN

He's the coolest one.

#### GORDON

Yeah, but his tophat still counts as his head so he has like 3 times the surface area for me to get a headshot.

#### WARREN

Well, yeah fine, let me be Mishkin then.

#### GORDON

No, I'm always Mishkin. You have everyone else to can be.

#### WARREN

But I would like to be Mishkin.

#### GORDON

No, you only want to be Mishkin cos you can't have him. I like the shape of his head.

#### WARREN

His head is square. They all have square heads.

#### GORDON

Come on!

#### WARREN

Oh oh look look, she's waddling, Gordon, she’s waddling.

#### GORDON

Waffles! Hey!

#### WARREN

To be fair, I did think tortoises came bigger than that.

#### GORDON

She's only wee. She came out of an egg remember. She'll get bigger. Like shoebox kind of big.

#### WARREN

Do you like her?

#### GORDON

She's my daughter now. Aren't you Waffles? Aren’t yah! Ow! She pinched me! Didn't you! I can't believe they actually gave us a tortoise.

#### WARREN

Well, that is the almighty power I wield.

##### [THE COMM CRACKLES]

#### GRACE

Warren, can we see you in the lab in 5 minutes, please? Over.

#### WARREN

That's a ten four. Over.

#### GORDON

A-ok.

#### WARREN

Roger Roger.

#### GRACE

What?

#### WARREN

Yep. Give me 5 minutes.

#### GRACE

That's what I said.

#### WARREN

I mean 10 minutes.

#### GORDON

Is that...is it time to -

#### WARREN

No, it's just more scans, I think.


##### [THE COMMS GO AGAIN]

#### GRACE

Gordon, I need you to help Pamela with the saline. We need to top up the supply, there's not enough down here for another freeze and Bryony wants him in before 7 o’clock.

##### [THEY PAUSE]

#### WARREN

Yeah er… We'll be there now.

#### GORDON

Warren, you've been out less than a week.

#### WARREN

Yeah well, they must be stepping it up.

#### GORDON

Look you know you don't have to actually -

#### WARREN

I know I know. I don't have to do anything.


##### [AWKWARD SILENCE]

#### GORDON

Warren. Do you...do you like going into hypersleep?

#### WARREN

Well… I like being good at something.

#### GORDON

You're good at GoldenEye. And you don't have to risk your life every time you play it.

#### WARREN

You’re gonna be here, when I get out?

#### GORDON

Always am.

#### WARREN

Well, if you're not, I get to be Mishkin. In perpetuity.

#### [CUT]

##### [IT RAINS AS AUBREY IS IN HER VAN]
##### [SHE POURS A CUP OF TEA AND BLOWS ON IT IMPATIENTLY]
##### [A LITTLE ALARM GOES OFF – SHE PICKS UP THE COMM AND CLICKS IT SIX TIMES]
##### [CLICK, STATIC, CLICK, STATIC]
##### [EVENTUALLY THE COMM CRACKLES TO LIFE]

#### GORDON

Hello?

#### AUBREY

Hi Gordon.

#### GORDON

Aubrey?

#### AUBREY

Yes, it's still me. How are you?

#### GORDON

I am freezing.

#### AUBREY

I'm sure there's plenty of places you could go inside where they wouldn't walk in on you.

#### GORDON

I don't trust anywhere inside. I don't really trust being outside. I don't know how long I can get away with this Aubrey. I can only pretend to inspect the guttering so many times.

#### AUBREY

To be honest you shouldn't be pretending. The icicles that build up on those gutters are lethal. They're like stalactites. I remember one broke off when Ben was carrying some equipment and bumped into a wall, I swear it would've gone straight through his head if it had hit him. Maybe I shouldn't stand beneath them then.

##### [A PAUSE]

#### GORDON

Aubrey?

#### AUBREY

I'm sorry. I just...I just can't believe he's dead. Ben. I mean I can, of course I can. It's why we were so careful all this time. We knew what they would do to us if they found us. I mean, I had to assume when he went quiet on me that they'd got to him. I just… I just can't believe he's been down there in one of those bloody pods. For Bryony to play with like he's a...

#### GORDON

Teddy bear?

#### AUBREY

Alright Gordon.

#### GORDON

At least you know it's equal opportunities butchery roung here. Anyone's head can be sawn off.

#### AUBREY

Ben Thomas was a lot of things but don't forget he helped you get all the information you were searching for on Red Valley, just like me.

#### GORDON

You're right. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry about Ben Thomas. He was your friend.

#### AUBREY

Well, let's not carried away, he was a twat. How's Warren?

#### GORDON

He went back in tonight.

#### AUBREY

Again? But it's only been -

#### GORDON

Five days. He's only been out of the lab for 3. This is the 5th time he's been in.

#### AUBREY

Why's she doing that?

#### GORDON

It's madness, isn't it? Clive Schill is right. If Warren's what you said he was, when he was in your van, you said he was the most valuable commodity Overhead could ever have. Why is she putting him at such risk if he's the golden egg? Gordon, I need to know what she's doing in there. I don't know what she's doing. Not the important stuff, I could never understand it.

#### AUBREY

But you're archiving for her as she goes, right? So you have access to the data?

#### GORDON

Yeah, she makes me catalogue everything.

#### AUBREY

Gordon, I need you to get as much of that as possible on to a storage device and take it into the tunnel.

#### GORDON

What?

#### AUBREY

You can do it. Say you're...exploring. For your archiving or whatever. Head down the tunnel, go all the way to the reactor housing, leave it somewhere conspicuous.

#### GORDON

And what's going to happen to it in there?

#### AUBREY

There's another way into the tunnel. From the other side of the Ballbag.

#### GORDON

There's...other mines that were supposed to be connected to it -

#### AUBREY

So, you've seen the plans then?

#### GORDON

Yes, but...how do you know they're even built, or safe?

#### AUBREY

I've been poking around one of them. It went really far.

#### GORDON

How far?

#### AUBREY

I don't know, I got scared and came back out again.

#### GORDON

I don't know about this Aubrey.

#### AUBREY

Look it's risky enough me even being this close so we can talk over the comm. The weather won't always be able to hide me so well. You can't come out and meet me. And frankly, if we're seriously talking about getting both of you out of there one day, we need to know whether that tunnel is a viable way in and out of the station. I thought you'd jump at the chance.

#### GORDON

To go down the terrifying tunnel built from an ancient granite mine into the middle of a mountain? Yeah… Sounds thrilling.

#### AUBREY

Gordon, it's not a dungeon. Your end is fine, it's totally safe. It's wired in, there's lights, it's fine. It's a fascinating concept actually.

#### GORDON

Well, send Grand Designs down there then.

#### AUBREY

Will you do it?

#### GORDON

I'm not going down there on my own. I'll take Warren when he next comes out.

#### AUBREY

But we don't know how long that could be. It could be weeks for all we know.

#### GORDON

I doubt it. Look, I'm not confronting a genuine phobia of being crushed by a thousand tonnes of rock by myself. Have you ever seen The Descent?

#### AUBREY

No.

#### GORDON

Neither have I. For that exact reason.

#### AUBREY

Very few people get the opportunity to face a phobia as specific as that. It could be a real breakthrough for you.

#### GORDON

I don't know if I like you, Aubrey.

#### AUBREY

Or you'll go down in history as the first man crushed to death by a ballbag.

##### [WARREN AND GORDON ARE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TUNNEL INTO THE MOUNTAIN]

#### GORDON

And you've got more batteries for your torch?

#### WARREN

Er... Yes.

#### GORDON

Did you bring snacks?

#### WARREN

Snacks?

#### GORDON

Yeah.

#### WARREN

How long do you think this tunnel is?

#### GORDON

It runs all the way into the mountain. Who knows.

#### WARREN

What's in your bag? I thought it was, like, recording equipment.

#### GORDON

It's just stuff -

#### WARREN

Is that a sleeping mat?

#### GORDON

I'm anxious about it, Warren.

#### WARREN

This was your idea. We don't have to go in. Who cares what's in there? I'll get the door.

##### [WARREN OPENS THE DOOR TO TH TUNNEL]

Oh my God, it's heavy.

#### [GRUNTS WITH THE EFFORT]

Oh my God, do you have to speak Parseltongue to open this?

#### GORDON

Let me help.

#### WARREN

I've got it.

#### GORDON

Look I can help -

#### WARREN

I said I've got it.

##### [IT FINALLY GIVES AND WARREN DRAGS IT'S HEAVY WEIGHT SO ITS FULLY OPEN]

#### GORDON

Warren. You've only been out of the lab a day, this is probably really stupid.

#### WARREN

We don't do these things because they're easy, but because they're hard.

#### GORDON

Was that JFK?

#### WARREN

Well yeah… that’s my best impression. This is this is very cool and scary, isn't it?

#### GORDON

Are you sure you're okay?

#### WARREN

I'm fine. Are you okay?

#### GORDON

Prop the door with that bin would you.

##### [CUT]

#### GORDON

Did the lights just flicker?

#### WARREN

No, it was me, just messing about with the torch. Be cool.

#### GORDON

I am cool.

#### WARREN

So. There isn't a prototype small micro -

#### GORDON

Small modular reactor.

#### WARREN

Yeah, right. So, there isn't one.

#### GORDON

No, no, it was just like the seed vault. They built everything for it but never saw it through.

#### WARREN

Or maybe it was another smoke screen to hide something else.

#### GORDON

I don't think we'd be able to get in so easily if that was the case. Overhead wouldn't just leave the door unlocked if they had a cloned Triceratops down here or something.

#### WARREN

But how else would it feed, Gordon. It needs to feed. And it only eats...archivists.

#### GORDON

Shut up.

##### [THEY WALK ON SILENTLY FOR A MOMENT]

#### WARREN

So, have you heard any more from, Aubrey?

#### GORDON

Yeah, I spoke to her the other night. While you were hypersleeping.

#### WARREN

You know you don't have to whisper down here.

#### GORDON

Considering how we got in this predicament you're very laissez-faire about being overheard.

#### WARREN

What did she say?

#### GORDON

Not a lot. She mainly wants to hear about you of course.
