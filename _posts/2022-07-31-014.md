#### GORDON

Aubrey this is dumb, this is dumb, this is so dumb -  

#### AUBREY

You said yourself we needed a plan. It's just happening now. It was never going to be as simple as walking out the front door. We're going out the tunnel. It'll be like the Shawshank Redemption.  

#### GORDON

The guy in The Shawshank Redemption planned his escape for like 30 years! We've cobbled this together in 30 minutes! 

#### AUBREY

I can assure you I've been thinking about returning to Red Valley for a lot longer than that. Where are you? 

#### GORDON

I'm in the Records Room. Bryony wanted me archiving the project so far. Where are you?  

#### AUBREY

I'm still in my van. I'm just finishing up. 

#### GORDON

What are you finishing up? 

##### [THERE IS THE BANGING OF ITEMS ON AUBREY'S END]

#### AUBREY

Just… just some essentials. 

##### [SOMETHING PINGS IN THE BACKGROUND]

#### GORDON

Are you… are you baking? 

#### AUBREY

In a way. 

#### GORDON

Well, when you've finished your creme diplomat do you fancy getting a move on? I don't know how much longer they're going to be. They could be back any moment.  

#### AUBREY

Okay. Tunnel door, midnight. You and Warren, don't worry about anything else. I'll take care of it.  

#### GORDON

Except Waffles. 

#### AUBREY

Well of course worry about Waffles. Just put her in a Tupperware or something. 

##### [CUT]

##### [THE HELICOPTER WHIRS AS THEY RETURN FROM GLASGOW]

#### CLIVE

Anyone want a top up? 

##### [THE CLINK OF CLIVE REFILLING HIS OWN WINE GLASS]

Don't make me drink alone guys. Warren, you've had 3 pints already, you should be in the zone. Let's celebrate! 

#### WARREN

No, thanks Clive, you're alright. 

#### CLIVE

Jeez. You're still hung up on the whole being a secret murderer, aren't you? Let it go, as my daughter sings to me at 5 in the morning. You did great tonight! You didn't fuck up once! 

##### [AN AWKWARD SILENCE]

Bryony. Let's have a drink. To old times. 

#### BRYONY

I've had quite enough of that piss Shiraz thank you, you're doing a fine job of toasting your own cock with it all by yourself.   

#### CLIVE

Bryony, come on. This is an occupational hazard. The axe could've swung just as easily towards me. I mean, who knows how the great minds of Overhead truly work.  

#### BRYONY

Yes. Who could have ever dreamed it would work out like this.  

#### CLIVE

You'll be fine. I'm sure Currys PC World always need a new refrigerator technician.  

##### [SILENCE]

Bloody hell, Bryony, I'm joking. I'm joking. Someone of your talents? Got Amos Tech, Jinx Industries, you'll be able to walk straight through the door. Or down the hatch, or through the airlock, or whatever weird little cellar you end up in. You just don't get to take Warren with you. It's not like you were terribly fond of him anyway, was it. You hear that, Warren? I'm your wife now. 

#### BRYONY

I'm sure you'll be very happy together.  

#### CLIVE

To us. 

##### [CLIVE TAKES A BIG DRINK]
##### [ANOTHER AWKWARD PAUSE]

Pretty wild that they played that recording from the station. Where did they get that from? 

#### BRYONY

The recording of Warren losing his mind that cost me my job but seemed to secure yours? 

#### CLIVE

Yeah. Warren? Got any ideas, mate? 

#### WARREN

Bryony's the one who likes everything recorded.  

#### CLIVE

Bloody hell, savage observations from Mr Godby.  

#### BRYONY

Yes. How poetic. I wonder how it could have happened. 

#### CLIVE

I mean it really wasn't smart of you Bryony. The Board know all my big talk is exactly that. It’s talk. But you start making shit up, you threatening to get a gun from your safe and shoot him like you're a Peaky Blinder...It don’t work coming from the likes of you. 

#### BRYONY

I guess I got carried away. 

#### CLIVE

We'll get to the bottom of it. I'll wave a fire extinguisher around a bit later, pull some vintage Clivisms out of the closet, we'll get the truth out. Maybe the glamorous assistants aren't so sweet and innocent after all. Maybe time for some changes in the lineup round here. 

#### BRYONY

You're probably right. Always good to have some new blood. 

##### [WARREN SNIFFS LOUDLY]

#### CLIVE

Oh Warren, watch out mate, your nose is going off again. Head back, watch the shirt. You look like you've been in a fight. Here's a tissue. 

#### WARREN

Sorry. Sorry Clive. 

##### [CLIVE DABS AT WARREN'S NOSE LIKE A FATHER TO A CHILD]

#### CLIVE

Fucking mad isn't it. All the bodies we burned through to get to this point and this plum ended up being the Jellicle Choice. 

##### [CUT]
##### [THE HELICOPTER HAS LANDED, THE ENGINE WINDING DOWN]
##### [THEIR VOICES ARE RAISED AS THEY WALK AWAY FROM THE NOISE, LOWERING TO NORMAL AS THEY REACH THE STATION]

#### WARREN

Are we going down to the lab now? 

#### CLIVE

One track mind, haven't you? Blimey. Straight to hyperbed with this one. 

##### [THEY REACH THE STATION DOOR AND CLIVE PULLS IT OPEN]
##### [THEY STEP INSIDE AND BEGIN STRIDING DOWN THE CORRIDOR]

So how do you want to do this? The Decommission Team will be a couple of hours, I guess.  

#### BRYONY

I suppose you want me to assemble all my work and hand it over to you. 

#### CLIVE

Hey, I don't make the rules. I just threaten people until they follow them. 

##### [BRYONY TURNS ON HER COMM]

#### BRYONY

Grace? Pamela, where are you? 

#### GRACE

Hello, hello. We're here. We're all ready. 

#### BRYONY

What do you mean? 

#### GRACE

We're all set up. For Warren. 

#### BRYONY

You've taken the Hartshorn out of containment? 

#### GRACE

Yes, yes, yes. It's all ready. 

#### BRYONY

I didn't ask you to do that, did I? 

#### GRACE

Um… No, I thought you'd want -  

#### BRYONY

It's fine. I'll be along shortly. Grace, I need you to collect all the hard copies of any data you and Pamela have produced since Warren emerged -  

#### CLIVE

Kontinued. 

#### BRYONY

So sorry. Since Warren 'Kontinued'. Be a good boy now. 

#### GRACE

Uh, right now? There's a lot I need to be prepari -  

#### BRYONY

Just fucking get on with it. 

#### CLIVE

Are you okay Dr Halbech? Not bottling anything up, are we? 

#### BRYONY

Clive there's a selection of files you're going to want in the office up here. I need to get Warren down to the lab so the minions can start to put him under before he drops dead in front of us. So, can you make a start gathering the paperwork? That isn't too much of an ask, I hope? 

#### CLIVE

No, happy to help. Hot to trot. Bryony, genuinely...no hard feelings, yeah? 

#### BRYONY

Clive, you can rest easy knowing after tonight I will never think about you again. Come along Warren.

#### WARREN

Sure. Bye Clive. 

#### CLIVE

Sweet dreams, cockchops. 

##### [CUT]
##### [GORDON, IN THE RECORDS ROOM – HE NERVOUSLY MUTTERS TO WAFFLES]

#### GORDON

Hey Waffles. We're just going to keep you in here for a bit so you're ready to go. Look, there's kitchen roll and lettuce, all your favourites. This was an ice cream tub. I haven't got any ice cream for you but, what's this? It's a Top Trump card. From the Lord of the Rings. It's a... wait who's that...Gamling. Who the hell was Gamling? Mad beard. You can eat this one. There you go. 

##### [THE COMM CRACKLES]

#### GRACE

Why does she want this data now?

#### PAMELA

How should I know? 

##### [GORDON PICKS UP HIS COMM]

#### GORDON

Oo… Um, she asked me to assemble the data in the archive too. 

#### GRACE

Something has happened. Something is going on.  

#### GORDON

Oh, no, no, I'm sure it's nothing. Just showing the big bosses all the great work you're doing. 

#### PAMELA

When did you go Team Overhead? 

#### GORDON

Oh, I'm not. It's just nothing to worry about, I'm sure. 

##### [A PAUSE AS GRACE MAKES HIS WAY DOWN THE CORRIDOR]

#### GRACE

Why are the lights out down here? 

#### PAMELA

Where?

#### GRACE

The door to the tunnel is open. 

#### PAMELA

What?

#### GRACE

The tunnel door. Why would it be open? 

#### GORDON

Oh, a yeah um, that would've been me. Sorry. Warren and I went for an explore not long ago. 

#### GRACE

Where does it go? 

#### PAMELA

It's empty, doesn't go anywhere. Stop screwing around, get the stuff she wanted and get back here, I'm doing this all by myself. 

##### [IN THE BACKGROUND A THREATENING ELECTRIC TONE BUILDING UP OVER A COUPLE OF SECONDS, THEN THE BANG OF A COMM HITTING THE FLOOR AND THEN STATIC]

Grace? Grace? 

##### [STATIC]

Gordon, what is going on? 

#### GORDON

Some of the comms have been glitching. I think it's the charging unit, they don't all sync up properly, look leave it with me. He'll be back in a minute, I'll get him a new one. 

#### PAMELA

Whatever.

##### [GORDON FRANTICALLY SWITCHES TO AUBREY'S CHANNEL]

#### GORDON

Aubrey? Aubrey! What the fuck is going on? Are you here? 

##### [CUT]
##### [INCIDENTAL MUSIC]


------


##### [GRACE HAS BACKED INTO THE WALL OF THE TUNNEL AND SLID DOWN IT A LITTLE AFTER BEING HIT WITH A LOWSTRENGTH ELECTRIC SHOCK]
##### [HE FLAILS IN THE DARKNESS, PANICKING]

#### GRACE

What the fuck was that? Who's there? What the fuck is this? 

#### AUBREY

This, Dr Melé, is a defibrillator. 

##### [THE HUM OF THE DEFIBRILLATOR CHARGES AGAIN AND THE BANG OF IMPACT AS SHE PUTS THE PADDLES ON EITHER SIDE OF GRACE'S ARMS]
##### [HE YELPS AND DROPS TO THE FLOOR OUT OF SHOCK]

Calm down, you big baby. That was barely enough to kill a salmon. 

#### GRACE

Oh my God, Jesus what have you done to me. You've put me into an arrhythmia. I need a... a 12 lead ECG to check for, for myocardial damage...who are you? 

##### [THE SOUND OF A ZIPPO LIGHTER BEING STRUCK]
##### [GRACE YELPS AGAIN]

#### AUBREY

I'm Aubrey Wood. I used to work here. How do you do? 

#### GRACE

Aubrey Wood... W... why are you...

#### AUBREY

Why am I illuminating the space between us with a zippo lighter? Well, if you look closer, you'll see I've duct-taped it to a can of my favourite antiperspirant. If you don't do exactly what I tell you I'm going to spray it, which will burn your face off. On the plus side you'll be protected from excess sweat and body odour for up to 48 hours. 

##### [GRACE TRIES TO SCRAMBLE TO HIS FEET]
##### [AUBREY SIGHS, AND HITS THE SPRAY CAN]
##### [A MASSIVE LICK OF FLAME SHOOTS OUT AND AUBREY PUSHES HIM BACK AGAINST THE WALL]
##### [GRACE CRIES OUT IN FEAR]

That is what a homemade flamethrower looks like. Next time you move, it's going in your eyeballs.  

#### GRACE

Oh my God, Jesus. Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay. 

#### AUBREY

Okay. Now reach out your hand. 

#### GRACE

Why?

#### AUBREY

Have you seen Terminator 2? 

#### GRACE

Um... Yes.  

##### [AUBREY RUFFLES THROUGH A BAG WITH HER SPARE HAND]

#### AUBREY

Do you remember the bit at the offices of the big bad tech company that made the Terminator? 

#### GRACE

Yes...

#### AUBREY

Right, hold this.  

#### GRACE

Okay. 

##### [GRACE TAKES IT WITHOUT THINKING]

#### AUBREY

Well done. Now, do you remember the bit where they give poor old Miles Dyson a trigger bomb, and when he lets go, the whole place explodes? 

#### GRACE

What?

##### [SHE REACHES OUT, PRESSES A BUTTON ON THE DEVICE SHE GAVE GRACE]
##### [IT BEEPS LOUDLY AND GRACE YELPS] 

#### AUBREY

Don't let go.  

##### [AUBREY GOES BACK INTO HER BAG]

#### GRACE

You've...you've got to be kidding...what is this connected to... 

#### AUBREY

That trigger is connected to a bomb I made. I watched a video and found some very questionable chatrooms and now I've gotten quite good at them. They use up an extraordinary amount of sugar, oddly enough. Stay still. 

#### GRACE

What are you doing now? 

#### AUBREY

Tying your legs up. 

##### [GRACE MAKES A PATHETIC LITTLE WHINE OF FEAR AS AUBREY TIES HIS LEGS TOGETHER]

You remind me of someone you know. My old partner, Ben Thomas. He was a lot like you. Smart in all the wrong places. Wrists please. Careful, don't drop the bomb. 

#### GRACE

Ben Thomas was your partner? 

#### AUBREY

Yes, did you know him? Ended up in one of Bryony's refrigerators. I have it on good authority she cut his skull open with a buzzsaw just the other week. 

#### GRACE

I... she made me throw his body in the furnace. I'd barely gotten out of the helicopter... she said she was spring cleaning... 

#### AUBREY

Bosses are just the worst, aren't they? 

##### [AUBREY FINISHES TYING GRACE'S WRISTS AND GETS UP TO LEAVE]

Okay. Sit tight.  

#### GRACE

Hey! Where are you going? 

#### AUBREY

Got some minor heroics to take care of.  

#### GRACE

Oh God! Jesus! 

##### [SHE WALKS OFF UP THE TUNNEL TOWARDS THE STATION, LEAVING GRACE BEHIND]
##### [AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SHE TURNS AROUND]

#### AUBREY

Hey, it's Grace, isn't it? 

#### GRACE

Yes! 

#### AUBREY

How many subjects have died on your watch? 

#### GRACE

What?

#### AUBREY

Since you got here. How many people have you had to help Bryony kill? 

#### GRACE

None. I'm not here to kill anyone. 

#### AUBREY

Well, maybe there's hope for you yet, Grace. Think about a career change before I get back.  

##### [CUT]

##### [BRYONY AND WARREN WALK DOWN THE STAIRS]

#### BRYONY

You can unclench your teeth now, Warren. It's over. You're going back to sleep, and you'll probably never see me again.  

#### WARREN

Yeah. Okay. 

#### BRYONY

Okay? Nothing else to say? After everything we've been through? 

#### WARREN

You guys all talk so much, I don't really have much to contribute at this point. 

#### BRYONY

Fucking hell, Warren! All the shit you and I have crawled through together and that's all you've got to say? 'I don't have much to contribute?' You and I have contributed more to this company, more to...to...science, than...fuck! 

#### WARREN

You alright?

#### BRYONY

An old man who looks like a human set of bagpipes, and a frumpy little cow who sounds like she born under a pool table, and they expect me to hear everything I've done described as an egg sandwich! An egg fucking sandwich!  

##### [SHE THROWS SOMETHING THAT CLATTERS ACROSS THE STAIRS.]

#### WARREN

I'm sure you'll just get another job. Like Clive said. 

#### BRYONY

You may have noticed that there's a recurrent theme linking the ex-staff of Red Valley, my love. You don't find many of us at the fucking Job Centre. 

#### WARREN

I never saw you get this angry when we were together. 

##### [BRYONY LAUGHS HOLLOWLY, AND TAKES A DEEP BREATH]

#### BRYONY

No. No, you didn't.  

##### [PAUSE]

#### WARREN

Was any of that ever real? You and me? 

#### BRYONY

No.

#### WARREN

Right.

#### BRYONY

Well, let's get it over with. Ah, the Records Room. Bear with me a moment, I just have to get something from the safe. 

##### [BRYONY CROSSES THE CORRIDOR AND OPENS THE DOOR TO THE RECORDS ROOM]

#### GORDON

Bryony! Jesus, you scared me. Warren? 

#### WARREN

Hey.  

#### BRYONY

Evening Gordon. How's that data coming along I asked you to collect? 

#### GORDON

Oh, yeah, it's all here. 

##### [GORDON PUSHES SOME HARD DRIVES ACROSS HIS DESK]

#### BRYONY

Wonderful. 

##### [BRYONY WALKS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM, TO THE SAFE]

#### GORDON

How was the meeting? 

#### WARREN

It was fine. What are you doing? 

#### GORDON

Oh nothing, I've finished up here, if you want to we cou-  

#### WARREN

We're just heading to the cryopod. 

##### [IN THE BACKGROUND, BRYONY PRESSES BUTTONS ON THE SAFE KEYPAD AND IT OPENS WITH A CLUNK]

#### GORDON

Oh, umm… do you think we could... hang out a bit, first? 

#### WARREN

I don't know man, it's late. It's been a long day.

##### [A CLICK]

#### GORDON

Come on, I haven't been out in ages. Let me live vicariously through you. Where did you go? 

#### WARREN

We went to a pub in Glasgow.  

#### GORDON

A pub?

#### WARREN

Yeah. It was quite nice actually. It was called the...what was it called? 

#### BRYONY

The Boat and Bridger. Oh Gordon, before I forget. Do you remember the night we cut open the skull of Ben Thomas, the poor old sod who used to work here, then ran away and betrayed us? 

#### WARREN

Sorry, wh… what are we talking about? 

#### BRYONY

I told you Clive found him and killed him. Do you remember that, Gordon?  

#### GORDON

I, what? 

#### BRYONY

I lied. Clive meant what he said up there, Warren. He's all talk, and no action.   

##### [A GUN BEING COCKED, AND THE IMMEDIATE AND LOUD CRACK OF A SINGLE GUNSHOT]
##### [THE HEAVY SLUMP OF A BODY HITTING THE FLOOR]

##### [TWO COMM UNITS]

#### CLIVE

What was that? Hello? 

#### PAMELA

Clive?

#### CLIVE

Pamela, what was that? 

#### PAMELA

I don't know, I'm in the cryosuite. Grace?  

#### CLIVE

Bryony?

##### [STATIC]

Bryony? 

##### [STATIC]

Fuck sake. Where is Gordon bloody Porlock? 

##### [CUT]
##### [AUBREY, FRESHLY EMERGED FROM THE TUNNEL, CREEPING DOWN THE CORRIDOR]
##### [SHE HISSES INTO HER COMM] 

#### AUBREY

Gordon? Gordon, what the hell was that? Gordon, I'm right by -  

##### [AT THE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR, THE FAMILIAR CLICK OF HEELS WALKING AWAY]
##### [AUBREY PUTS THE COMM DOWN]
##### [A SHARP INTAKE OF BREATH, THEN A SHOUT IN ANGER]

Bryony! 

##### [BRYONY TURNS ON THE SPOT IN SURPRISE]
##### [THEY TALK FROM OPPOSING ENDS OF THE CORRIDOR, THE RECORDS ROOM BETWEEN THEM]

#### BRYONY

My God. Aubrey Wood? Is that a bobble hat you're wearing? Good lord, you haven't been living down here all along, have you? Like that Parasite movie? 

#### AUBREY

Where's Gordon? 

#### BRYONY

Ohhh... I see what's happened. I have you to thank for my new professional freedom, do I? Should've known Mr Porlock wasn't capable of a dastardly plot like that all by himself. Well, it seems we'll both be freelancers then. We can do LinkedIn or something.  

##### [AUBREY PULLS SOMETHING FROM HER BAG]

#### AUBREY

Bryony, where is Gordon? 

#### BRYONY

What… what is that you're holding? 

#### AUBREY

It's a pipe bomb.  

#### BRYONY

Ah. Is it real? 

#### AUBREY

Very much so. I gave the fake one to your handsome assistant to hold on to. 

#### BRYONY

Well, as impressive as your commitment to grassroots terrorism is, it's not very effective in this situation, I'm afraid. You need something much more focused, like this. 

##### [BRYONY PULLS HER GUN AND IMMEDIATELY FIRES IT AT AUBREY]

#### AUBREY

Shit!

##### [AUBREY DUCKS BEHIND A WALL AS THE SHOT HITS IT WITH A METALLIC CLANG, FOLLOWED BY TWO MORE SHOTS WITH THE SAME EFFECT]
##### [AFTER A MOMENT OF SILENCE, THE SOUND OF THE DOOR TO THE STAIRWELL OPENING AND SLAMMING, FOOTSTEPS RUNNING AWAY]
##### [AUBREY, BREATHING HARD, POKES HER HEAD ROUND THE WALL]
##### [SHE GOES TO HER COMM FRANTICALLY AS SHE RUSHES DOWN THE CORRIDOR TOWARDS THE RECORDS ROOM]

Gordon? Warren? Are either of you… Are either of you - 

##### [SHE OPENS THE DOOR WITH A CREAK]

#### WARREN

Help me. Help me. Please. Help me.

#### AUBREY

Oh my God.

_Fuck! Warren, what happened to Gordon -_

_Gordon's been shot. He's breathing but we can't help him like this. I need the emergency drugs box, I need the airway kit, we need to move him, and we're going to need blood. Grace is in the tunnel, about 30 yards down, he's tied up and he's holding a bomb but it’s a fake, okay, you need to untie him, and get what we need. I need all hands on deck, alright?_

_You said Gordon was shot. In the stomach._

_Yeah, and I don't plan on ending up the same way. You just said that woman attacked you with a jerryrigged defibrillator strapped to her back! She's insane!_

Would you like me to stop playing these recordings Aubrey? I imagine they may be upsetting to you.

No. And you don't have the capacity to imagine. Skip. 

##### [GORD CONTINUES]

#### _AUBREY_

_More blood._

_There's no point putting more blood up. That's it, we don't have any more than this. Hello?_

#### _AUBREY_

_I'm thinking._

#### _GRACE_

_What?_

#### _AUBREY_

_We can put him in the cryopod._

#### _GRACE_

_The pod?_

_How long does it take to set up?_

#### _GRACE_

_It's... it's fully set up, we were going to put Warren in tonight. The Hartshorn is ready to go._

##### _[AUBREY IS THINKING HARD]_

#### _AUBREY_

_Halbech was working on the haemostatic properties of the infusion, right, so it could be used in emergency medicine. Wasn't she?_

_How do you know that?_

#### _AUBREY_

_Gordon told me. Fuck it. Freezing someone is the easy part. We'll worry about the rest later. Come on, Warren. We need to move him. Warren?_

#### _WARREN_

_I can't do this. Aubrey, I can't..._

##### _[A CLATTER AS WARREN DROPS TO THE FLOOR]_

#### _AUBREY_

_Warren!_ 

#### _WARREN_

_I…_

#### _GRACE_

_Warren, your nose is bleeding. Oh... shit, he's bleeding from his ear as well._

#### _AUBREY_

_Warren. Warren. Warren, hey! Look at me!_

#### _GRACE_

_Oh God! What's happening to him?_

#### _AUBREY_

_He's in shock._

#### _WARREN_

_I can't... put me back... please just put me back... put me back... put me back..._

#### AUBREY

Gord, stop it.

##### [HESTER HAS ENTERED THE CRYOSUITE – SHE PULLS UP A CHAIR BY AUBREY]

Hester.

#### HESTER

What are you doing? 

#### AUBREY

Reliving the good times.

#### HESTER

I brought the tortoise down. Thought she could visit Gordon, he is her dad after all.

#### AUBREY

Hey Waffles. Big girl. 

#### HESTER

She likes it on top of the pod, I think. I mean, as much as she likes anything. She just stands there.

##### [SHE PUTS WAFFLES DOWN ON GORDON'S POD – THEY SIT FOR A MOMENT]

You want to talk about it?

#### AUBREY

Bryony had cleared out the remaining Hartshorn on her way out and left in the helicopter. God knows where she went. But there was an infusion left over. It had been meant for Warren before he was taken to Glasgow. The night you saw him in The Boat and Bridger. It should've been wasted, Grace or Pam should've thrown it in the furnace because it had been out of containment too long, it would've been degraded, too risky to use. But with everything that was going on, they hadn't gotten round to it yet, and we didn't have a choice. Warren was going into shock and starting to haemorrhage, the first signs his body was finally giving up on the treatment. Gordon... well, the bullet had gone straight through, we didn't have any more blood to give, he was going to bleed out in a matter of minutes. So, I used the good infusion on Warren, and the degraded one on Gordon. Warren was the best hope for a successful emergence. 

#### HESTER

You had to make the call. You were still trying to save them both.  

#### AUBREY

It was messy. Really… messy. We got them both into their own pod. We spent an hour or so moving them into the tunnel. To... right here, where we're sitting now. Then Grace and I blew up the tunnel entrances at both ends. Sealed them in the mountain. Our first bombing.  

#### HESTER

I made you stop the recording before you started blowing things up with homemade bombs? 

#### AUBREY

It was hardly -  

#### HESTER

Gord… Gord, please tell me there's a tape of that. 

#### AUBREY

It's a fractured recording but of course.  

##### [A RECORDING BEGINS]
##### [IN THE DISTANCE A FIRE ALARM BLARES]

#### _AUBREY_

_Is that it? Is that everything? Where's the anaesthetic vapour? That'll go up like nobody's business._

#### _GRACE_

_Well, no it's not everything, but I also don't want to be buried alive._

#### _AUBREY_

_You've got everything you want to take?_

#### _GRACE_

_Yes. Yes, You?_

#### _AUBREY_

_Anything I thought was useful. And one tortoise in a Tupperware._

#### _GRACE_

_Right._

#### _AUBREY_

_Right. This is crazy. Are you sure those pods are going to hold out?_

#### _GRACE_

_Oh no, they're built to endure. The whole idea is if the rest of the world goes to pieces around it, the cryopod still survives. They'll be as safe as they can be. Unless you can fit them in your van._
