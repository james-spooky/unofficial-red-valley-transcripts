##### [GORDON'S CAR. RAIN SOFTLY FALLS ON THE WINDOWS, ON THE ROOF. FROM THE STEREO, A RECORDING PLAYS. THE SOUND IS DISTANT AND NOT EASY TO DISCERN AT FIRST. THIS IS A RECORDING FROM A ROOM. FOOTSTEPS CLICK ACROSS A METALLIC FLOOR. MACHINES BEEP AND VENTILATORS HISS. INTERMITTENT CONVERSATION, ONLY SHORT BURTS AND SHORTER ANSWERS]

#### WARREN

This isn't a log recording, what is this? 

#### GORDON

This is the audio from the video feed inside the cryo suite at Red Valley. I have the video too, but like I said, I'm trying to break you in gently. This is where it all happens. So, let's set the scene. You've got your six candidates for the Teddy Bears Picnic. 6 guys full of synthetic blood about to be put in induced comas and cryonically frozen. Yogi is dead after having a massive reaction to the infusion they're giving him just days before. That leaves five. Just like you heard Wood say, the picnic was due to start the coming Monday. And it did. The other five, uh, Brown, Black, Grizzly, Polar and Pooh, they all go into the, uh, capsules, the...cryo pods. They're hooked up to every bit of monitoring going, like a super intensive care unit, they're fully anaesthetised, tubes in their mouths, in their arms, in their cocks, the lot.
