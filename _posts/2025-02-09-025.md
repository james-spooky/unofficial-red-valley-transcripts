##### [THE WARD. COMMOTION AS THE PATIENTS ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO THE SUBLEVEL. BEDS BEING PUSHED PAST, TROLLEYS WITH SQUEAKY WHEELS, CONVERSATIONS, RAISED VOICES. MARMITE, IN THE BACKGROUND, ARGUES WITH ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE NURSING TEAM]

#### NURSE

Marmite put the bed up before you unplug it or it won't go.

#### MARMITE

Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

#### NURSE

Then why are we having this conversation?

##### [A BED RATTLES PAST. SHE CALLS OVER TO WARREN, WHO'S LOADING A LINEN TROLLEY]

#### NURSE

You okay there, Warren?

#### WARREN

Uh, yeah!

#### NURSE

Just take what we need, you don’t need to pile up everything.

#### WARREN

Sure!

##### [HE LOWERS HIS VOICE]

#### WARREN

Cause I know what we need. For anything whatsoever.

##### [HE MOVES SHEETS FROM THE CLOSET TO HIS TROLLEY]

#### WARREN

Gord, does this happen often? Moving everyone around like this?

#### GORD

We have evacuation drills to the sub level every 4 months.

#### WARREN

The real thing though. Like, not a drill.

#### GORD

There have been 3 occasions since my activation where a risk assessment advised the precautionary measure of sub level evac.

#### WARREN

So, this isn't the first time something scary has happened. People are like ready for it.

#### GORD

Two of them were threats from other communities that were successfully averted through negotiation and trade agreement. The third was a flock of pink-footed geese that Marmite mistook for an airborne assault.

##### [THIS IS NOT COMFORTING INFORMATION]

#### WARREN

Cool cool cool.

##### [WARREN'S COMM CRACKLES. IT'S HESTER]

#### HESTER

Warren, it's Hester. How are you doing up there?

#### WARREN

Uh, fine thanks. It's all very busy.

#### HESTER

Just do what you can. You're an extra pair of hands, we're grateful.

#### WARREN

Right. Hester, there are a lot of things going on here that I don't understand, and it all feels like a lot of fuss, are you absolutely sure that this isn't all my fault?

#### HESTER

It isn't your fault.

#### WARREN

It feels like it might be my fault.

#### HESTER

With respect Warren, it isn't always about you.

#### WARREN

I... Wow, alright. Jesus.

##### [CUT TO: HESTER, WALKING DOWN A BUSY CORRIDOR. PEOPLE MOVE BY HER QUICKLY] 

#### HESTER

Sorry. I was experimenting with tough love.

WARREN

That's more Aubrey's area, isn't it?

##### [THE CLATTER OF ITEMS BEING DROPPED ON THE FLOOR. HESTER SHOUTS AT WHOEVER DROPPED THEM]

#### HESTER

Watch what you're doing with those! We don't have time to forge new weapons!

#### WARREN

What?

#### HESTER

Don't worry about it! Warren, once everything is in place I'll be running things from the Control room - if you'd rather join us down there than be in your quarters, you're welcome.

#### WARREN

Okay, thanks. Bye.

##### [WARREN CLICKS OFF. HESTER CLICKS THROUGH CHANNELS, AND GRUMBLES TO HERSELF]

#### HESTER

Stevie? Where are we?

##### [CUT TO: STEVIE, IN THE FARMHOUSE. IT'S QUIET, JUST THE CREAK OF A FLOORBOARD HERE AND THERE]

#### STEVIE

Hi Hester. I'm at the house. Defences are live, don't send anyone else out here now.

#### HESTER

And the valley floor defence system?

#### STEVIE

I mean, everything looks good. As long as the reactor is happy it should work fine. I'll make my way back now, does Grace need any help?

#### HESTER

I don't know if he's in the operating room or fetching our special guest.

#### STEVIE

Aye, I'll check. If he's okay, I'll see you in Control.

##### [STEVIE TURNS HER COMM TO A DIFFERENT CHANNEL]

#### STEVIE

Grace? It's Stevie. I'm done at the farmhouse, do you need a hand?

#### GRACE

No, thank you Stevie, all in hand. Head to Control.

##### [CUT TO: GRACE, WHO'S STANDING IN BRYONY HALBECH'S CELL]

#### STEVIE: Sure thing boss. Careful around the evil genius. Remember she's a good shot at throwing shoes.

#### GRACE

Thank you for the advice, Stevie.

##### [HE IS ONLY A COUPLE OF METRES AWAY FROM BRYONY]

#### BRYONY

Surely I’m not the first person to throw a shoe at her. How can you live alongside such relentless pluckiness?

#### GRACE

It's time to get to work, Bryony.

##### [BRYONY YAWNS AND STRETCHES]

#### BRYONY

Righty. So, do I get a lab, a team? What kind of timeframe are we working with? I'll need a few days to survey what kit you have in the future...

#### GRACE: The bad people might be coming to kill us all sometime over the weekend. So, we thought we'd better crack on and get it done tonight.

##### [BRYONY LAUGHS HEARTILY FOR PERHAPS THE FIRST TIME EVER]

#### BRYONY

Oh, sure. Sure! Why not. It's the weekend you say? I do hope there's music. I'm sure Aubrey runs a fun emergence.

#### GRACE

I'll be in charge of Gordon's emergence.

#### BRYONY

Oh really? And what's Aubrey up to?

#### GRACE

Everything else.

##### [CUT TO: MALCOLM'S QUARTERS. AUBREY IS ADMINISTERING SOME MEDICATION TO MALCOLM. MALCOLM IS SUBDUED BUT QUITE UPBEAT]

#### AUBREY

Hold still.

#### MALCOLM

Yes.

##### [AUBREY GIVES HIM AN INJECTION]

#### AUBREY

And there.

##### MALCOLM

You know umm... You know I can do my own injections.

#### AUBREY

I know you can. Just wanted to.
 
#### MALCOLM

How are you feeling?

#### AUBREY

I'm fine.

#### MALCOLM

So am I. Isn't that strange?

#### AUBREY

You and I are alike that way. It's the standing still that kills us. Days like this... that's when we come to life.

##### [MALCOLM GRUNTS A LAUGH AT THIS,]

#### AUBREY

You sure you're okay, Malcolm?

#### MALCOLM

Don't be soft. I'll be alright. You just do what you're best at.

#### AUBREY

Alright.

#### MALCOLM

Hold your bloody nerve, Aubrey. And maybe we both get what we want.
