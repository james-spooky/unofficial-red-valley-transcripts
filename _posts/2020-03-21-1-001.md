##### [THE ABRUPT CLICK OF A TAPE RECORDER BEING SWITCHED ON.]

#### MALE VOICE #1

Was that it? Is it on?

#### MALE VOICE #2

Wait, hang on a second... Wait. Yep, it's on. 

#### MALE VOICE #1

Okay.

#### MALE VOICE #2

Okay. Go ahead. 

#### MALE VOICE #1

Oh wait, shall we start this conversation again, or what? 

#### MALE VOICE #2

No, no. Let's just carry on. 

#### MALE VOICE #1

That doesn't sound very formal to me. 

#### MALE VOICE #2

Well, it isn'tâ€¦ formal. It's private, I thought that was the point.

##### [MALE VOICE #1 SIGHS.]

What? 

#### MALE VOICE #1

I want you to take this seriously, okay? 

#### MALE VOICE #2

I do. I am.

#### MALE VOICE #1

I need you to.  

#### MALE VOICE #2

I promise you, I'm taking this seriously. Come on, you asked me to record it, I went and got your Dictaphone. Go ahead, please.

#### MALE VOICE #1

How much do you know about cryonic preservation? 

#### MALE VOICE #2

Cryonic...preservation? 

#### MALE VOICE #1

You mean like Walt Disn -  

#### MALE VOICE #2

I swear to God if you say anything about Walt Disney's frozen fucking head, I am hanging up this phone right now. 

##### [CAR INTERIOR. A PHONE CALL. HOLD MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY, AND THEN ABRUPTLY CUTS AS A PHONE IS PICKED UP.]
