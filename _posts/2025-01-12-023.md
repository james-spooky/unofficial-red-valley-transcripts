##### [WARREN IS SORTING WAFFLES' VIVARIUM IN HIS NEW QUARTERS, HE DRAGS IT AROUND THE FLOOR, GERRING IT IN PLACE]

#### WARREN

Why is this so heavy? This way, this way, this way. Okay. Tortoise house here? Or tortoise house there?

#### GORD

I don't have a preference. 

#### WARREN

Well what do you think she would like?

#### GORD

I don't believe she would have a preference. 

#### WARREN

Here's fine. 

#### GORD

I concur

#### WARREN

Are you sure it's okay to have Waffles in my room?

#### GORD

Hester said it was fine.


#### WARREN

I don't want people thinking I've just swooped in and taken the tortoise as my own

#### GORD

No one thinks that. 

#### WARREN

Cause she was never my tortoise anyway. She was Gordon's

#### GORD

Everyone knows that. 

#### WARREN

It's just that... after 40 years I can't really lay any claim to the tortoise. 

#### GORD

It's perfectly normal that you would like to keep the tortoise close to you at this early stage of acclimatising to your surroundings. She was present in your time and she's still here now. It must be reassuring. 

#### WARREN

Does she mind though?

#### GORD

Who?

#### WARREN

Waffles. Obviously. 

#### GORD

I assure you Waffes has no opinion on the matter whatsoever. 

#### WARREN

You know it feels much more homey getting a gunmetal grey windowless underground cell of my very own

#### GORD

Your short resting period in the farmhouse was only a temprary measure as the weather was clement. A treat. 

##### [WARREN LAUGHS AT THIS]

#### WARREN

A treat. 

##### [HE FUSSES WITH THE VIVARIUM]

#### WARREN

I'm gonna move it agin.

#### GORD

Would you like to lsiten to another excerpt from Gordon's memoir?

#### WARREN

Maybe we could skip to a good bit. Umm... Is there a good bit? You know, like when Gordon gets into some fun scrapes or car chases. 

#### GORD

There is a degree of intrigue and suspense as Gordon surreptitiously investigates Overhead Industrues but most of the 'scrapes' as you would call them, are in the form of arguments in online chatrooms which are transcribes in comprehensive detail - 

#### WARREN

Ugh. That's gross. No thanks. 

#### GORD

He does provide an illegally recorded telephone exchange with a man who ran a fledgeling cryonics business behind a battery hen house in Iowa which includes some interesting insight into the freezing of livesto -
